Actual service required waiting for the bar staff to bother to meander over, repeated attempts to order a specific wine variety off the menu met with blank stares and questions of if it's a Chardonay.. After 4 attempts get them to realise it does exist. No proactive service, no chat\/banter interest show, had to stand at the bar waiting for someone to turn up to order another wine. It's a hotel bar. Do not go here if you aren't a guest with a voucher and even if you are, better bars a block either way.",

Fresh Spring Rolls - Light, crisp, and packed with herbs, prawns, and vermicelli. The peanut dipping sauce on the side was rich and creamy, perfectly tying it all together. A great way to start the meal! 5-Star Fried Vermicelli - This dish was a standout! Smoky wok-fried vermicelli, topped with crispy shallots, lemongrass chicken, and just the right hint of spice. It had that perfect balance of texture-crispy edges with soft noodles underneath. 5-Star Special Broken Rice - A total flavour bomb. The grilled pork chop was juicy and marinated to perfection, paired with a crispy spring roll, shredded pork skin, and a soft egg. The rice was fragrant and fluffy, and the fish sauce drizzle brought everything together. Service was friendly, food came out fast, and the portions were generous. Highly recommend if you're after authentic, satisfying Vietnamese in town. Would definitely come back!",

He made sure we had everything we needed without us ever having to ask, and even served us with a special anniversary dessert, which made the night extra special. The food was outstanding, steak was a perfect 5\/5, cooked beautifully and packed with flavor. The pork dish was also delicious, around 4\/5, but still very enjoyable.

Someone answered the phone, I asked my question and he answered me in a heavily thick Afghan accent yes we are open and hung up. I found that funny. My hotel check in clerk recommended this restaurant to me and said it was delicious. I got to the restaurant and it was jammed packed. I was looking at the menu on the wall and someone waiting for carry out said to me \"you have to ask the cook what he has tonight\". The menu is never updated. There is only the cook and a cashier\/assistant working in the restaurant. So I approached the cook who was working furiously in an open kitchen in the same area as the dine in tables, carry out waiting area and cashier. There were about 20 people sitting at communal tables and when a dish was ready for the seated guests the cook would just hand the dish to the nearest customer waiting for carry out or to pay at the cash register and asked them to take to \"that table\". He was working furiously and had not yet noticed me standing in front of him. He was doing about six carry out containers at once with rice, one chicken kebab and one ground meat kebab with a side of salad. He looked up and started giving people their carry out orders and each was 20 NZ dollars or about 14.50 US (per person). All the time smiling and greeting everyone with hellos and goodbyes unless you were Muslim then it was assalamualaikum (peace be unto you). I told him I will have that same dish and he assembled it on the spot and added another container and said this is free. I was hoping that was Afghan bread. I paid my 20 dollars and left. The food was some of the best Afghan food I have ever had. I lived in Afghanistan for awhile and have eaten Afghan food in many other countries. The ground meat kebab was lamb, it was moist and had all the right spices, superb! The chicken kebab was marinated in a red yogurt spice which resembled red Tika but tasted better. The rice was divine and the extra container was a butter style curry chicken with two chicken legs that was spicy hot. It was the best butter chicken I have ever had. I had no room for the salad so it went uneaten. If I go back to NZ I will make a side trip just to eat here. All portions were huge.",

The portion was generous, and the toppings were nicely balanced. The only downside was the big rice noodles, which were a bit too soft and soggy for my taste. Still, overall a great find if you're craving something warm, spicy, and different without breaking the bank.",

I would re-order everything we had tonight and, while I didn't take a photo of every plate, let me just say that each of these tasted better than similar dishes I had at a 'higher end' restaurant the night before. I'd be more than happy to order just the croquettes for myself, but add the prawn linguini to it and it's so, so good. Our table also split a rib-eye which was cooked well to our temp, the pork mac & cheese, and the buttermilked fried chicken entree. Very happy with the cocktails as well. Basically, happy with everything which is why I'm writing this to remind myself that YES I would come back again next time I'm in Christchurch.",

The server was quick to get our drink orders but we were never given menus for food by either the host or server. About 15-20 minutes go by before we were able to get hold of the server that took our drink order and was told they are only serving snacks. We were not told this when we asked to be seated and had we known when we got in, we wouldn't have even bothered ordering drinks. The website mentions that the dinner is served from 5 PM to late and we had arrived at around 8:15 PM which is not late at all, since they were open until 12 AM that day. Super disappointed with the service and lack of informing us that they are no longer serving dinner when we asked for a table for two. Hands down the most disappointing experience in New Zealand so far especially when the other reviews hyped up the restaurant.",

Our server was Hamish and I've seldom had some recommend dishes with such passion and outstanding knowledge of the ingredients to create perfect cocktail pairings! We ordered the rainmaker and missionary's downfall at our server's recommendation and both drinks were some of the best cocktails I've ever had. Later on, my husband got an Inca Haze. Also an excellent drink! Moving on to food, we asked out server for recommendations and followed his direction and he did not steer us wrong. The chargrilled jalapeno sausage was flavorful, delicious and had great dipping sauces. I wish it was a bit more jalapeno-y, but I know spicy food scares people here... We moved on to the Pork Belly and Broccolini. Wow. The pork belly had a perfectly crispy layer of skin on top, the inside was tender and not overly fatty (due to the rotisserie cooking process maybe) and served on black bean sauce with pineapple salsa. Fantastic! And who gets excited about broccolini? Anyone who eats the broccolini from here. Delicious! We scrapped every bit of sauce off the plate under the veggies. To finish we got the Zesti Roasted pineapple. Wonderful taste explosion! Fruity, spicy, creamy,, everything you want in a dessert. I also appreciate how helpful our server Hamish and the other staff were. About 90% through our meal another couple was seated next to me, who I can only describe as a perfume-bomb. The smell was so overwhelming it was almost sending me into an asthma attack and I couldn't breathe. The put our dessert into a to-go container and got our bill and we were able to finish our meal on the patio out front. I hate people who dip-dye their body in perfume and fumigate the rest of us. I appreciate the restaurant's help in allowing me to escape from the cloud of perfume as soon as possible.",

The waiting staff are prompt and friendly, can not fault the service :) What really makes this place stand out for me is their knowledge around food safety for my pregnant wife. We ordered some french fries as a side plate which on the menu comes with a spicy mayonnaise. The waitress identified that my wife was pregnant (a brave call but she is obviously pregnant), and informed us that the mayonnaise had raw egg in it and that she can bring a small dish of ketchup if that would be better. It's the first place that we've been to during the pregnancy where the staff were knowledgeable and informed about the food safety recommendations for women who are pregnant. Good work Amazonita!! Additionally the food is delicious and well priced, and with a wide range of food you are sure to find something that you feel like. Looking forward to many more trips to this awesome restaurant.",

The Beef Steak, Chicken Teppan and White fish were definitely the highlights - perfectly cooked, tender, and full of flavour. Service was great too, very attentive and friendly. The Assorted Tempura Set was okay - I really liked the vegetable tempura, but the fish was a bit dry. The Bento Set was also just okay. Not terrible, but for the price I expected a little more. They could've added a small salad instead of leaving one of the compartments just for sauce. The sushi tasted like supermarket sushi and the fried dumplings felt like they came from frozen, so that part was a bit of a downside for me. And the Salmon was a bit overcooked in my opinion - the juiciness was gone, which was a bit of a bummer! Still, a pleasant lunch spot overall - I'd come back for the teppanyaki dishes!",

I tried a bit and it was so hard and salty I could not believe any restaurant would serve up such a terrible meal.

You can choose any sauce to substitute for any meal that comes with one, so I got peanut satay for my rolls and it rocked. I love that user-friendly aspect - menu just felt like it was there to explain what they can practically make, and if I wanted it a certain way I felt it could be accomodated. Nobody likes to get charged $2.50 extra because they wanted aioli not ketchup, after all. Popping boba limonade was a novelty for me and was a great refreshment against the rich food.",

        "text":"Barefoot Eatery (\u014ctautahi) - Review by Zee Tana Visited: Friday morning, 10:30am Dined with: My partner Occasion: First-time visit, curious to try a fully vegan spot \u2e3b We decided to try Barefoot Eatery in central \u014ctautahi for a relaxed Friday morning breakfast. As a vegan-friendly establishment with a strong online reputation, we had decent hopes - especially for a plant based-aligned offering. Unfortunately, while the caf\u00e9 looked good on the surface, the experience didn't quite live up to the visuals. First Impressions The location is central and easy to get to. The space is light, open, and inviting, with an earthy, conscious vibe. However, it was immediately clear that the place was understaffed - just one staff member running front-of-house during a busy Matariki morning crowd. They were doing their best, but the service naturally suffered because of it. Service Friendly but understandably stretched thin. No formal welcome, no check-in at the table, and minimal interaction beyond the counter. With only one person juggling coffee orders, seating, and food delivery, there was little opportunity for engagement or support. For what we paid, we hoped for more than just transactional. Food & Drink We ordered: \u2022 2x Big Vegan Breakfasts \u2022 1 Soy Latte \u2022 1 Long Black \/ Americano Let's start with the highlight: the coffee was excellent - easily the best part of the morning. Smooth, strong, well-balanced, and perfectly made. That alone almost made up for the kai\u2026 but not quite. The Big Vegan Breakfasts looked amazing when they landed at the table - visually, they were vibrant and beautifully plated. But the flavour didn't match the appearance: \u2022 The scrambled tofu was watery and overpowered by the crispy chilli oil - lacking the depth we expected from black salt or seasoning. \u2022 The mushrooms (only four small slices, and shrivelled) felt like an afterthought. \u2022 The sausages were small and bland. \u2022 No butter or spread on the bread, and no salt or pepper available to help adjust the flavour. \u2022 The beans, tomato, salad, and aioli were delicious and well-balanced, saving the plate from a total letdown. The portioning across the plate was inconsistent - some items felt generous, others almost tokenistic. The cost: $91 total, including a 15% Matariki surcharge (not unexpected, but it raised expectations that weren't met). Overall Experience There's potential here, especially for vegan kai lovers looking for a light, stylish brunch spot. But for us, the value just didn't add up. The coffee is worth coming back for - but not the full breakfast experience, not at that price, and not until they sort out the balance between staffing and service. \u2e3b Final Thoughts Aesthetically pleasing but lacking in substance where it matters most - flavour and service. We left feeling a bit underwhelmed",

From the moment we walked in Lawson and Ava were so attentive and friendly - any restaurant would be lucky to have them.

Our starter arrived at the same time as our mains, so was barely touched, we were not meal checked at all, and my sirloin was so chewy half remained on my plate, my daughter's Flintstone was tender, but her duckfat potatoes had been cooked in a dirty fryer, should be golden, not brown and crumbly. As the nervous waitress (also smelling strongly of cigarette smoke), didn't know seasonal veges we took pity on her and ordered salads, also acceptable but nothing great. Staff were apologetic about mixup in delivery and offered 1 free drink, which i didn't accept, I expected the starter to not be charged for. They took it off with reluctance, and when presented with gold card she took it, but didn't get right discount. Unfortunately she didn't offer receipt, and I was to flustered to ask. Definitely will not be returning.",

The poached eggs were overcooked, the cheese scone was lumpy (they hadn't even heated it), and the apple and caramel muffin was dry (it didn't taste like apple at all). To top it off, their card machine broke down just as we arrived. They told us they were fixing it and that we should order anyway. In the end, they didn't fix it, and after spending three weeks on vacation in New Zealand without withdrawing any cash, on the last day, a few hours before boarding our flight, we had to withdraw money and pay the ATM \u20ac3 in fees because of this breakfast. If they had told us we had to pay in cash, we would have gone somewhere else (and maybe we would have had a decent breakfast).

Compared to other cafes in chch, this is by far the best! The food always comes out so quickly (sometimes amazingly quick) and the staff make a point to be friendly which makes it overall such a great environment and experience- no matter if you're by yourself doing a bit of work, or with a group of friends out for brunch. It's always a very busy place which tells me I'm not alone in my love of this place. Lastly, as a barista of many years and a very picky person when it comes to coffee, I'd like to make a point of saying how consistently delicious the coffee is here, no matter what kind!

I had the avocado smash - a poached egg on thick multigrain toast with a huge dollop of avocado on it. My wife had shakshouka - this first time I've ever seen this outside of Israel.

He went to the back to cancel one of our steaks. The manager then comes out and says it's too late. That they're already being prepared. That he would give us 50% off the steak.

With crunchy bacon and dressing on side. The chicken was a bit dry. The salmon main was delicious garnished with mussels. Just warm with crunchy seared skin. The prices for the beef mainswere similar to countries which didn't grow cows. So took a rain check fora birthday party or anniversary.",

Leading up to the main meal we had the garlic flat bread and oysters which came out both fast and incredibly tasty. They were probably some of the best oysters I had and were light enough to prepare for the main dish. The steak itself was incredible. The meat was so tender and flavorful that you didn't need any additional sauce or seasoning, however if you want an extra level of depth I enjoyed the garlic butter and peppercorn sauces for just the right amount of added flavor. Afterwards we had the Mary's affagato which wrapped up the flavors perfectly. Honestly the food was so good it left me almost in tears. The meat here is also sourced from a halal plant in the area so it's friendly for Muslim travelers like myself. A must-stop place if you find yourself in Christchurch.",

It felt like an honour to witness it. The take away menu is clearly marked with vegan options. We ordered the onion bhaji, mushroom pakora, dal tadka, aloo mutter & eggplant korma. The rice was complimentary. The onion bhaji were a little more dense & chewy than I am used to, but all of the food was genuinely delicious and we couldn't fault it. \"Medium\" heat for the curries was perfect for us, and the containers were generously filled.

They even make paneer in an organic way from fresh milk. If you ordered and wait around 15 to minutes then you will be served a healthy, delicious and fresh food. I can't wait to eat next time.",

A huge shout-out to Akhil (unsure if he's the owner or staff, but he's amazing!). His warm hospitality truly made us feel at home right away. He was so kind and friendly, even taking the time to greet our 7-month-old baby boy with such a genuine smile. It really warmed our hearts. We ordered the Hungry Man and Tattooed Lady. Wow! These beef burgers were absolutely massive and delicious - we could barely finish them! Such a satisfying meal. Thank you, Akhil, for the wonderful welcome to your beautiful country. We will definitely be back! (Don't forget to leave a review for a free ice cream sundae too!",

The beer, I'd say you can't go wrong with the Three Boys craft brew. I loved the lamb shanks and my friend had the pizza which he finished entirely (make what you will of that).

The staff are very charismatic and the Ramen I ordered was delicious , I've visited a total of 8 Japanese restaurants here in Christchurch and this one is in the top 2, because the proportion of meat in the Ramen was just right, neither too much nor too little. I will definitely come back, especially to try the Udon. Ps: they also have hamburgers, probably to make the Kiwis happy hahaha.",

The staff were lovely but when we are paying that price, I don't expect them to be reading off a list what is on the plate and I felt sorry for our waitress as I had to show her how to open a bottle of wine as it had a cork in it, not her fault, she should have been trained, because she pocketed the cork and filled the glasses up with out letting us taste it first. It took too long between courses, as they are very small, they need to come out faster - we were informed that the kitchen staff were overwhelmed - not sure why as you have to book and it is a set menu. Finally, pudding was not great, the honey cake tasted stale or had only just been taken out of the fridge and not brought up to room temperature These small things would not normally make me out in a review but this should be a top experience",

I wanted to take my boyfriend out for a nice meal for his birthday (since he's quite a foodie) and was referred by the chef's cousin. We opted for the fine dining and had the 6 course meal that the chef picked, as we didn't know what to choose haha! Each course was so delicious: melt-in-your-mouth truffle pasta, delicious fish with herbs, perfectly cooked beef, creamy chicken and Waldorf salad, a tangy and sweet rhubarb sorbet, and a lovely chocolate fondant for the birthday boy. Mmmm so yum!! They cater to your choices so don't feel like you have to get something you don't like. I'm not a big oyster fan and they were accommodating to not give us that in the meal. They take you to the back room in a beautiful dining section. The staff are so attentive and helpful. We aren't super fancy people and I felt like we fit in just fine. Obviously we dressed up and had a few wines. The meal is expensive, but you get what you pay for. All in all, amazing food, great ambiance, and helpful staff. What more can you ask for?",

Loads of beef, rich black bean flavor, not too salty - perfect with fluffy white rice. I couldn't stop eating. My girlfriend got the Mushroom Chicken Rice The chicken was tender and full of flavor, and the mushrooms soaked up all the delicious sauce. Super comforting and satisfying! The best part? Both meals together were under $30 - and we were absolutely stuffed. Total bargain! Highlights: Only $13 and seriously filling (this ain't a small lunch box) Cooked fresh to order, served piping hot Home-style taste, not oily - easy to eat every day Tip: Come during lunch specials for the best value! \u2e3b They also offer Lunch Combo Meals for $15-$16: $15: Chicken corn soup + 4 mini spring rolls or chips + seasonal veg + chicken\/beef fried rice or noodles $16: Soup + sweet & sour pork, lemon chicken, fried fish or nuggets + rice + veg Big portions - no one leaves hungry Lots of variety - perfect for switching it up No service charge - casual and affordable for daily lunch!",

The atmosphere is warm and welcoming, perfect for anything from a casual lunch to a relaxed dinner with friends. I tried the char kway teow and wat dan hor - both were fantastic. The char kway teow had just the right smoky wok hei, and the wat dan hor came with silky noodles in a rich, eggy sauce that was pure comfort. Everything felt fresh, flavourful, and cooked with care. The prices are fair for the generous portions. It's the kind of place you'll want to come back to - sometimes for the Malaysian classics, sometimes for a simple, well-made noodle dish.

        "text":"Hidden Gem: Unassuming Shop, Legendary Hainanese Chicken Rice Sometimes the best food comes from the most unexpected places - and this low-key little shop just proved that to me in the most delicious way. Chicken That's Unbelievably Tender The poached chicken was silky, juicy, and full of flavor. You can tell it's been cooked with care - no dryness, no toughness, just pure, melt-in-your-mouth perfection with a light chicken aroma. Fragrant Chicken Oil Rice The rice is hands-down one of the stars of the dish. Cooked in chicken broth and oil, each grain is separate and glistening with flavor. Honestly, I could eat a whole bowl of just the rice! The Holy Trinity of Sauces The classic trio - ginger paste, chili sauce, and sweet soy sauce - were all spot on. Balanced, homemade-tasting, and they elevate the chicken to another level when mixed and matched. Bok Choy on the Side Instead of the usual cucumber, this place served lightly blanched bok choy. Crisp, vibrant, and soaking in just a hint of that savory chicken flavor - it was the perfect complement and added a homey touch. Comforting Soup Included A bowl of hot, clean-tasting chicken broth comes with the set - light but flavorful, and a lovely warm finish to the meal. From the outside, this shop might not catch your eye. But take one bite of their Hainanese chicken rice and you'll instantly know - this is the real deal. No hype, no frills, just honest, heartwarming food done really well. Definitely a hidden gem worth discovering.",

Service is great..we have become regulars from well ova 10 years now..they're always surprised when I bring the kids just how big and tsll they are. Usually I'm holding out and going there when HUNGRY or craving soup or stew. Recommend this place to at least try once. And the plain fried rice no meat tastes like there's meat in it. Thanku my friends for this place.",

The bartender Danielle is a sweetheart and damn good at what she does . If you want to have a low key, fun, yet local experience you should definitely visit this place.

        "text":"My friend was celebrating his 2nd 30th birthday here with his buds, and prior to my attending, I checked out the reviews. There's this one girl that has it all wrong. This place is awesome. I'm 30yrs old at current, and she claimed that she and her friend were in their 20's. Yes, the crowd is more mature, but it is mixed. I was there with people my age, people older than us, and people younger than us, and not everyone who was there was there for the birthday boy. I dressed up too, but I didn't feel out of place. You wear what you want, within reason\/appropriateness, and the better dressed you are the less it can hurt! The bartenders were kind and professional. There's one pool table at the center where people can pay to play. Two C-shaped booth areas one to the left of the entrance upon walking in, and one at the rear left behind the mini-stage where we got to be entertained by a local singer. She sang mellow and sad cover songs, which sounded nice, but were not the right tune for the night. The background music they played when the singer took breaks was chill and upbeat, and not excessively loud! Yay, don't have to scream over each other to order a drink or have a conversation. The highchairs at the bar area aren't stationed in and can be moved about, which is great for small to medium sized groups. The restrooms are at the rear of the space. Decent and plenty of space. I did not try any of the bites, only had a beer ($5.00) and a glass of water. It's part of a mini shopping center, and it's a hidden gem, if you ask me. Next time some friends opt to hang out there or celebrate, I'll be back! Happy Eats\/Drinks\/Lounging!",

I was honestly in jeans and a t-shirt and was the best dressed in this place. People were in sweats - which would have been FINE if, when we walked in, we weren't looked up and down because we didn't look like slobs and didn't fit in. It was so uncomfortable. We're in our twenties and were looking for a place to catch up and talk- but we left before even having a drink. We were BY FAR the youngest by 30 years. At least. It was not clean, not friendly.",

They poured a nice drink and remained attentive and friendly throughout our meal without being intrusive. Go for the salt and pepper squid, excellently fried and crispy. Followed that with the mussels, but asked the chef to please do a simple steamed which he did, no problem. I did the garden salad, amazingly fresh, lightly dressed and my partner did the baked market fish - on this evening monkfish - and prawns. Superbly done. We finished up with tea, coffee and the burnt cream - a lemon and almond creme burlee with a peanut butter cookie. Amazing. Would go back in a blink.",

This Christchurch staple serves up two styles with two restaurants in one - Astro Bar is in the back. Cook'n with Gas - traditional New Zealand dishes done right. The keystone to the menu is lamb shanks with a mint jelly that will make a impression in the memory. The wine menu and pairings highlight what New Zealand has to offer to the wine world. Astro Bar - good for drinks beforehand, after dinner, or a meal if you're not looking for the Cook'n with Gas full experience. As the signs in the bar say, \"May the sauce be with you.\" Don't miss out on the Atomic fries and sauce. Asaph Street may be for the up 'n comers and a good place to extend your night, but this is an essential Christchurch stop.",

Our table was nearer the back of the restaurant and had a lot of space around it so we didn't feel crammed in and were able to be a little bit noisy. The food was fantastic, all the meat was perfectly cooked and delicious. I had the mussels as a starter and it was a very generous helping and the flavours were spot on. Next I had the mixed grill and wouldn't hesitate to order it again. Chocolate brownie for dessert was rich and decadent and a perfect finish. I tried most of the other dishes on the menu that other people had ordered and couldn't fault them. What made dining at cook'n' with gas really special was the service. I think it takes a lot to make an impact as a server and NZ has a lot of good but not great service. Our waiter had extensive knowledge of wine and kept us entertained during the evening. Every wine choice he made was superb - it went with our meals and with our individual taste preferences. As a result I now have a few new favourite wines to hunt down!",

I got great advice on trying the best oysters I have had the fortune of trying in all my visits to NZ and it was unusually matched with a dark hoppy ale that was supposing terrific! I asked for some tabasco and got that plus Lemon and Cracked pepper too. Next came my lamb cutlets which were beautifully prepared and was promised a match unique wine; unfortunately the later never arrived, and since by now the restaurant had started to fill I was unable to flag down anyone to point out this fact till long after the meal was done. Pressing on I tried the chocolate dessert that despite my fears it would be too sweet I was assured that it was the most elegant to try and it delivered as good as I was promised. Unfortunately again when it came to getting the bill I had to wait 10 minutes to get someone's attention and again for them to return with my receipts so that I could leave. Despite these few small missed that seem due to not enough staff or over booking at one time this was a most enjoyable dinning experience.",

We decided to go after a comedy show & arrived at the St Asaph St Corianders at 9.30pm very hungry. Staff were very welcoming & said they were open until 11pm so we could get a table for two. We explained that we needed all our food to be Vegan & Gluten-free & they said they could do that. We ordered vegetable pakoras & onion bhajis for starters & a glass of wine each which was all very delicious. The waitress bought out a yoghurt sauce with the starters which was quickly whisked away by the head waiter as it had dairy in it. So we thought that they had the allergies & dietary requirements sorted. We ordered two curries to share with rice as our main both from the vegan menu & were told that the curries were also GF & Vegan (we always ask several times as this combination is very rarely catered for well at any cafe or restaurant anywhere in NZ). Everything was absolutely delicious & we were impressed with the soya chunks in the curries (used instead of chicken in the vegan curries), so much so that I asked where I could source it for my Vegan, 99% GF wholefood cafe in Timaru. I was told by the waiter that it was called Soya Chaap & could get the tins of it at local Indian Supermarket or through food service providers. Later that night my husband was feeling very uncomfortable with gut pain & bloating & the next day he was not well at all, barely able to function. He is very intolerant to gluten (basically a coeliac), but we couldn't figure it out as we were sure that Coriander's had catered to our vegan & GF needs. We decided to go to the Indian Supermarket to buy some of those tins of Soya Chaap & to our great disappointment discovered that they contained not only soy, but gluten wheat flour which was the 1st ingredient. So as we own a 99% GF cafe, I definitely couldn't use it at all. We are very hot on making sure the 1% of ingredients that do contain Gluten in our cafe (organic oat milk & organic date scones) do not ever get cross contaminated with the GF ingredients (as my hubby is very intolerant of course). Anyway, I am very sorry to have to write all of this as we initially were thoroughly impressed with the service & the delicious food but I feel like I had to do this review to let other folks who are GF know that they can't have the vegan curries with the soy pieces in them as not GF. My hubby was sick enough from just one meal but it could have been much worse for someone with chronic Coeliac Disease. Suggest staff need more training all round both FOH & Kitchen staff as they may not be aware of the gluten content of the Soya Chaap they are using but it was clearly labelled on the tins of all the different brands at the Indian Supermarket. We won't be going back unfortunately, which we are very sad about.",

I had the Village Style Kleftiko and my wife had the Canterbury Lamb Platter, wow, I mean far out. The Kleftiko was absolutely stunning, so full of flavour and fall apart melt in your mouth chunks of lamb, we of course sampled each others and my wife's was stunning as well, she concurred. Of course we had to have dessert and this is what sets Costas apart from every other dinning experience I've ever had. You've just had a beautiful main and in our case an entre not to mention a couple of wines and you're beginning to feel a bit full but you'd like a dessert, something sweet to finish things off. Enter Costas mini desserts, what a brilliant idea, you don't have to pay the full price of a dessert and its just enough so you're not left with that I ate too much feeling. I had the Baklava Ice Cream and my wife had the Chocolate Mousse, both excellent. All in all, a fantastic experience, beautiful food, great atmosphere and good service. Highly recommend Costas, can't wait to go back.",

        "text":"It's either Greek food is simply average Arabic food or I'm not a fan of Greek food. We ordered all of our dishes from Souvlaki Platters section: we went with the falafel, chicken and lamb. All of these plates come with Greek salad, pita bread, four different sauces and your choice of side dish (rice, potatoes, or French fries) The falafel was way below average. In the description they highlight it as crisp from the outside and moist from the inside, it was moist on both layers. Also felt very oily, should decrease the oil to get it to be crispy from the outside. The chicken was good but then again I like this dish so it's hard not to satisfy me. The taste is very similar to \"sheesh taowe\" from a Lebanese restaurant. I would recommend ordering the chicken dish. The lamb was just ok and again felt like \"tikka\" from a Lebanese restaurant so nothing special there. Finally we got the baklava for dessert. The portion was big (we ordered the big size they also do have a mini if you want to taste) and it was good. Again I tasted mush better in Turkish restaurants. Overall good restaurant if you want a middle eastern food in Christchurch.",

The staff was very friendly and helpful and the owner Javier stopped by the table twice to say hello and talk about the preparation of the dishes. We had been to the restaurant before the big quake and had heard that they had damage and had been closed for quite some time. We wondered if it would be as good as we remembered - and is was! We had several tapas plates followed by lamb shoulder and a Spanish seafood stew. They were top notch. The wine list was not spectacular but solid and we had no trouble finding good pairings. Of course, dining at the Curators is not complete if you don't take the time to roam the gardens. A real first class garden mixing both a working garden and a decorative. All in all a real complete experience!",

The location is lovely, adjacent to the botanical gardens, and the restaurant itself, is, as the name states, in the old curators cottage so history and charm abound. We were lucky to get in on this Thursday night, the place was busy but I was lucky as my concierge pulled some strings and got us a cute table for two right in front of the window overlooking the garden. A prime location, indeed! Service was a bit slow which is why not the perfect score, but that may have been due to the fact that the place was very busy as it was a holiday the next day. While they are known for their Spanish tapas, their menu has a pretty wide range. Depending on how you want to eat, you can order a range of tapas to share as your dinner or a couple of tapas to begin with and then a couple of mains. We chose to do the latter. First up, we split the charcuterie plate. This thing was huge and came with several kinds of meat as well as some bruschetta to enjoy it in. We also had the lamb tapas which also was perfect for sharing. For my main, I went with the lamb shoulder special of the day which was super tasty and very tender. My friend wanted a steak and his came out perfectly prepared as well. The ambiance is cute and the food is very good. I also liked that the location allows for a stroll before or after dinner in the beautiful botanical gardens. Dinner with drinks for two ran about $168 which was really reasonable given the quantity of food we consumed. Too bad I don't live closer as this would go on my \"to go again\" list for sure!",

Decor is nice, its a wonderful old house with fantastic views across Hagley Park. Post-EQ I would say its a lovely place to come for drinks when the sun is shining. The outdoor area overlooking the park is amazingly relaxing on a warm summers afternoon\/evening. Last time I ate here though I have to say I was quite disappointed. There was a group of 6 of us and the meals were nothing special. Two of the steaks which had been requested medium-rare were in fact very well done and chewy and not so nice to eat, bordering on inedible. We debated saying anything as all of us are quite non-confrontational but one of us took up the baton and made the waiter aware! He ended up comping some desserts but I couldn't recommend this place on food alone. Although the chocolate mousse was good, the rest of the food was underwhelming. Maybe we hit the chef on a bad day? I probably won't be back for dinner, unless someone else makes the reservations. On my last experience I would give this place 2.5 stars but seeing as I can't give half stars though yelp I rounded up to three as two seemed a little harsh. It gets rounded up for the outside drinks area.",

The waitress looked like she really didn't care and had so many other places she'd rather be (which is probably true but at least pretend!) None of us have been back since.

To be fair, if we were told or asked to us the QR code from the start we would've been happy to do so. 3\/4 of our drinks arrived, the next arrived several mins after that. The food we ordered was actually really good (and the waitress that bought it out was very pleasant). I don't know why no one bothered to serve us today, I have enjoyed coming here in the past but today missed the mark completely when it comes to service.

Today's waffles were so dry that they needed absolutely drowning in maple syrup to choke them down. Our visitors said multiple times today that they regretted ordering them. Embarrassing. Portions are generally small. Other times have had poor experiences. Food can take forever to arrive on occasion. Need to constantly beg for drinks\/refills, including those we had actually ordered - service is excruiatingly slow. It doesn't seem as if the owners have experienced a real American diner. It's too hard. The theme is great and we want to love it, but this is a terrible example of Christchurch hospitality. The quality of the average Christchurch cafe is much higher than this. We eat out a lot and just cannot recommend this to others in good faith. The theme is the drawcard but on arrival, they do not deliver on anything except the bill.",

We got the sliced beef in tongue numbing sauce and the pork dumplings in Sichuan style sauce. The dumplings were soft and flavourful, the pork's natural oil coated my lips nicely. The sliced beef was the standard velveted beef, the kicker is the sauce. Make sure to have Jasmine rice on the side to soak up all the flavour. They were very generous with the serving, three people could be full with the sliced beef. The atmosphere was eccentric, kids would definitely have a blast looking at the paper statues of minecraft characters, a gigantic ice age character with his wallnut, and Chinese decorations. Despite its unusual decor, the temperature and the overall atmosphere makes you feel very at peace while eating and conversing with your loved ones. I cannot stop talking about how the table and chair are the perfect height in relation to each other, it just makes you feel extra comfortable in the space. I would highly recommend eating in, the service was very accommodating. They asked for my preference for forks or chopsticks, hot water, and if I needed more spice. Overall, this place does well in what it does. 5\/5. Edit: We came back again, it was the best fried rice we have ever tasted. I thought it would be the usual fried rice from Chinese takeaways, but this one was different. It was not oily, the wok hei is to die for. They made it spicy just for us because we seem to have ordered only spicy food off the menu, which was nice. The wontons were so soft and tender. The intestine noodle soup was way more flavourful than our usual noodle spot in Riccarton. It definitely satisfied our spicy cravings. The front of house person is always accommodating, a stark contrast to some restaurants around the city. We went back for a third time, but didn't realise they are closed on Wednesdays.",

As an in-house restaurant the decor is toned down, but pleasant. The staff are both friendly and attentive. The menu choice is smaller than you might expect at an Indian restaurant, but the food was well cooked, being very well spiced and delicious. I had Paneer Padkora entree, which is made using their own made Paneer. It was my first try of tbis dish and I wasnt disappointed. For main I had Chicken Kadhi (hot) with plain rice and Naan. The main was beautifully spiced with great balance and very tasty. The rice portion was spot on, enough to enjoy with the main, leaving enough gravy to mop up using the Naan. It was a great meal, and I would definitely go again.",

Calamari strips and fried chicken were both decent enough deep fried items, and the seafood chowder was good enough to hit the spot on an evening rapidly turning cool.

Now the only main that can be made vegan is a quinoa salad, where the halloumi is removed and not replaced with anything. I didn't want to pay $30 for just a quinoa salad, so I ended up with a starter for dinner, which was just flatbread with vegetables (goats cheese was removed and not replaced with anything) The new menu is disappointing and my non-vegan family was also not really impressed with their meals",

The toilets are very unclean (we were at 17:30,so things couldn't get better after i think, and it was pretty bad). We ordered croquets for first, cocktails and for main we ordered the steak and gnocchi. At no point (not while given the menus nor when the order was taken) the waiters (different ones) bothered to notify us that the steak was not included in first table, like they do in other restaurants. cocktails were very good, croquets not bad (had better but it were good). The mains arrived. The steak was good but relatively small and about 30 percent of it were hard fat. This is not something i would expect in a restaurant, definitely not for this price. The gnocchi was excellent but the quantity of gnocchi was small (most of the dish was sauce, that was excellent but that's not the point). We had two more cocktails and finished with affogato which was good. As we paid, i realized the steak wasn't in the deal. I'm not the kind of person to argue so we paid and left. Overall our savings were 24$, definitely not worth it. In general, the whole experience was underwhelming and left a bitter taste. I wouldn't come again.",

Firstly, I was going to be charged 20$ more, luckily I realised before I tapped my card. I ordered a mixed grill platter for 1, everything was cooked beautifully down to the sauces however the rump cap was extremely tough. When I sent it back the server wasn't helpful, he said they cannot replace it because I ate most of it, which was a lie (it was practically inedible ) . This went back and forth because I was very frustrated . I then agreed to have it cooked longer (against my will) , to then be given a brand new piece of rump, after all that fuss lol.

It works like the food court classic Hungry Wok, but the flavours are way more authentic and tailored for Chinese tastes. Tons of options to choose from, freshly cooked and steaming hot. From what I saw (and tasted!): \u2022 Spicy chicken, tomato-braised chicken, mapo tofu \u2022 Stir-fried black fungus and cabbage, saut\u00e9ed shredded potatoes, dry-fried green beans \u2022 Soy-braised eggplant, Chinese-style scrambled eggs, twice-cooked pork, home-style pork stew\u2026 You choose one base (white rice, fried rice, or fried noodles) and three hot dishes, all served fast and generously. The flavours are bold and savoury - not overly sweet like Westernised Asian food - perfect for a real Chinese meal. Staff speaks Mandarin, super friendly and quick service. Perfect for students, workers, or anyone who wants a filling, flavourful lunch or dinner. Located right near Riccarton's shopping area, so you can grab a hot meal before or after errands. Takeaway boxes are sturdy and packed to the brim. Great value, authentic taste, and fast service - what more do you need?",

Steak was fresh and locally sourced, paired with a delicious mushroom gravy and the side of vegetables were roasted well. Would note that the steak was medium-well done despite asking for rare. Thoughtful staff who did ask kindly about steak cooking preference and gave a lovely sauce recommendation. The ladies were happy to quickly set us up at a private 2-diner table. The atmosphere was warm and homey, with a semi formal arrangement inside and some tables undercover outside as well. Sweet Italian music and nice ambiance overall. No pianist on our night but there was a piano inside so you might be lucky! Ordered: Canterbury steak, beef rag\u00fa pappardelle",

On another occasion we decided to try the sushi burger with chicken. It ended up being difficult to hold since the chicken was sliding out from between the two rice patties.

We were really craving sushi, but unfortunately their sushi department is rather lacking and they aren't made fresh to order. I tried the Teppan Teriyaki Chicken Bento Value Set and the chicken was extremely tender. The rice was cooked okay and the miso soup was good, but the salad lacked any dressing. My husband and I also ordered edamame as well as our other friend and they only brough one order to us. After we explained it to them, it took about 10 minutes to get the other edamame and they had to verify with us 3 times that we actually did order two. My husband had the salmon ngiri which looked really fresh, and the Tori Tama (hot udon noodles with a fried egg and crispy chicken) which was really flavorful. I would come back for that!

Pretty interesting things on offer here, different from your typical sushi joint. A particularly interesting offer was the rice burgers. In place of a bun the burgers had a sicky rice cake. Sounded weird but totally worked. Bit of a letdown how few veg options were on offer here. They were also a bit inflexible on adding\/subbing tofu to things, which I wasn't too pleased about. We veggie types need protein too!!! I went for the tempura burger which was strangely delightful. Crunchy tempura in place of meat, with peri peri sauce. I have to admit I went back for a second I was so taken with it! Also got the agadashi tofu which was really nice. My dinner mates got some of the noodle bowls which looked beautiful with lots of different toppings. An interesting place, not sure I am dying to go back, except maybe for a rice burger from time to time!!",

Pork Katsu Curry- very thick portion of pork. The crust was crispy, generous portion of rice, and lots of curry sauce. Karagi donburi- the flavor went through the batter and into the chicken, crispy, and juicy pieces. A good choice if you're feenin' for fried chicken.

        "text":"Our last meal in Christchurch. After a movie in Riccarton, we decided to check out Hello Vietnam Restaurant for pho. They specialize in Southern Vietnamese (believe they are from Can Tho). We dropped in on a Wednesday evening (around 8:15pm) and the place was packed. A mix of customers which is a good sign. FYI: it's BYO (for wine only). The menu is humongous; appetizers, salad, soup, rice noodle soup, rice vermicelli, fried egg noodle, fried rice noodle, steamed rice, fried rice, meat dishes (chicken\/beef\/pork\/squid\/fish\/prawn), tofu, vegetable, egg omelet, chef special menu, roast duck and desserts. They even have a couple set menu options. So many things. Only thing I ever look it as the pho\/speciality soups! - Pho dac biet (#23) ($16.00 NZD) - special beef rice noodle soup. Comes with the standard bean sprouts and basil (super fresh!). Broth is flavourful but on the sweeter side (Southern Vietnam influence). A bit too sweet for my liking. Meat was generous and a good variety; beef tendon, beef flank, pork balls, tendon and oxtail. Oxtail was bomb. - Bun rieu cau ($13.00 NZD) - spicy crab rice vermicelli soup. Always a must whenever I see this on the menu! This was delicious; fantastic broth with depth and flavour. Good variety of meats including two tender meat balls, pork, a small piece of pork rib and crab. There was also a few tomatoes, tofu puffs (silky smooth) and green onion. I ate every last bit. Super satisfying last meal. We were stuffed and in food coma heaven. 4.5 stars.",

I ordered the lamb burger, and it was one of the best meals I've had in New Zealand - juicy meat, fresh vegetables, and a perfectly seasoned sauce. The service was incredibly friendly and professional, and it's clear the team truly enjoys what they do. The interior is stylish, but not overdone - warm lighting, plants, and pleasant background music. It's the perfect place for both lunch and an evening dinner after a busy day.

Unfortunately, the business was sold and has rapidly gone down hill. The quality of the food has taken a nose dive and the treatment of customers has done the same. After avoiding the place for a few months after his last dissatisfied experience there. today he went back as he'd received an offer for $5 off. Big mistake, the protein size has decreased the chips were inconsistently cut and therefore terribly cooked. And that is not the worst part: The food was contaminated.

We ordered their pork ribs and two plates of red eye steaks. As we arrived at the restaurant very early, all the tables were empty. The food was served quickly. The ribs were pre-cut, and the size was small. Upon first trying the meat, it was soft and lacked the grilled, fire-roasted flavor. We ordered the red eye steaks to be served medium and medium-rare, but it turned out the steaks were prepared medium and well done. The fries were good and well prepared. Overall, the service was okay, as the staff couldn't understand and communicate with us well, except for the boss.",

She took a bit long time and slowly back to the counter to wash her hands (I wonder how dirty the cutlery she just served are). Guess what, while she turned around to me she found new customers behind me and ask me wait for she seating them first! I only need three dishes to order, I believe it's less time than her wash her hands, she wasted every one's time to keep herself looks busy! I have to left the restaurant before I loose my temper.

The food was quite good for Christchurch, though a bit pricier than other Hong Kong and Cantonese restaurants. The chef's skills were commendable. The credit card fee was very inconvenient for customers from China, especially given the limited number of payment options in New Zealand. I saw many people still paying in cash. The steamed fish was a bit pricey, at $78 NZD. There was no price when ordering, and only three of us could share. The fish's belly was completely unscaled, neatly arranged on the belly. The rest of the dishes were quite good.",

Within that familiar flavor lies a different memory each time. After school as a kid, I'd bike past this little noodle shop. In high school, I'd sneak out at lunch for a bowl of Cambodian kuy teav. Even after long shifts at work, I'd still find my way back for a hot bowl. Everyone has that one noodle soup they call their own. For me, this isn't just lunch or dinner, and definitely not just street food - It's a taste of home, and a timeline of my life. The broth is made from chicken bones simmered all day - rich, yet clean. The rice noodles are silky, the beef slices cooked just right, Finished with a spoon of that signature tangy chili sauce - Each bite is familiar, each sip carries me back to childhood. It's been 30 years. The stall has changed, the owner too. But this bowl of soup, this flavor - never did. - #CambodiaBeefNoodleSoup #TasteOfHome #30YearsOfNoodles #KuyTeav #CambodianStreetFood #NostalgicFlavors #MySoulFood #FoodWithMemory #ComfortInABowl",

On that day I didn't order chicken luksa by my friend recommended but I ordered Tom yum noodles soup instead. When my food coming the portions is enough for 1 or you can share with your friend if you didn't eat much. The soup was tasty a little bit spicy and sour. You will get a lot of rice noodles in your soup. It good to have soup in cold weather. 19$ for one meal is not to expensive for my opinion at this stage. And also they have a lot of variety food you can choose to try like spicy beef bamboo, pork omelette and chicken on rice. Recommended to try to have food in this restaurant. If you like spicy you can ask staff to made more spicy",

Ask for extra bowel of chicken bone also. Service- friendly but it's not really where you go for service Price- starting to go up.

It's located on the second floor that you reach by stairs or lift. The cocktail list was good. The food menu had many different choices and you're encouraged to share. Unfortunately our waitress didn't keep track of who ordered what and dishes come out at separate times. A server would just stand at the end of the table with a plate and yell \"who ordered this?\" And many wrong dishes were brought to our table. My favorite dishes were the Akaroa Salmon (so good) and the shrimp dumplings (the broth was insanely delicious). I would order this dish every time. My friends liked the crawfish slider. The duck was extremely fatty and we didn't even finish it. We had even asked the waitress if it was fatty, and said it wasn't, which is what encouraged us to order it. I didn't like the scallops at all.",

We did arrive early around 5:30pm so the place was quiet and we received attention promptly. Try a glass of Cloudy Bay Brut! Excellent and better than some much higher priced bubbly I've had. Or the Daquiri which has a nice hint of cinnamon. We had pork wontons which were served golden brown and hot with a sweet and savoury dipping sauce. Then we had the Kung Pao Chicken (perfectly spiced and made with a rich dark soy base) and a Vegetarian Pad Thai...beware the chilies on the side are potent. A side of rice and a few beers and all was great. Friendly and attentive service also. One of our favourite meals in New Zealand.",

My family of four descended on this place, and did, I think, a great job of ordering (with a little advice from a very helpful waiter). We had crispy skin chicken: delicious, moist and tender with delicate crisp skin, great spices, and an insane vinegar broth to dip in. There was duck breast in red curry: nice thick, spicy sweet coconut curry, tender duck breast with good flavor, and not too much fat, plus nice peppers and veggies besides. And we did Szechuan lamb, which, honestly, was not very Szechuan, if you ask me? But was pretty delicious. Tender, good flavor and not gamey, good sauce. Just missing some Szechuan heat, or that tingly Szechuan peppercorn flavor I love so much. And we finished that all off with some of their sauteed greens. The American in me reads that to be \"wilted spinach\" - no thanks - but it's more Asian greens, more substantial than just wilted leaf lettuce, and they're quite nice. Fresh tasting, crisp and not overcooked, nice stir fry sauce. An easy choice to accompany any dish if you're hungry for some greens, these kind of hit the spot. Broken record - price very reasonable for what we got. Service was very friendly too. If you're looking for Asian in Christchurch, this is definitely worth checking out.",

What it is... a fusion of Asian flavors with local proteins and ingredients. And in that sense of flavor spirit they do just fine thank you, dojei, kham Sam me da, khap Khun ma khap. Strong bold and spicy flavors with generous NZ portions (in Asia they would be half the size). No disrespect intended, but you can only eat so much Fish and Chips and lamb roast. So a night or meal of a different flavor from another mother is a nice accent to the forever weekly manja monotone. It ain't any one Asian food profiles but a melange of flavors. And 9,000 or 12,000 km from the home country it's all good! Deep fried Pork hock was outstanding! With lettuce wraps and mayo\/rice and Kim Chee pur\u00e9e? Different take and One hock portion, needs one tummy plus to make this go away. Clams with homemade XO? Your got to be gutsy to pull this off. And it works in a kiwi kind of way. Even straight up chicken wings are as finger licking good as creamy spiced mayo dip can make it. Decent wine list with a thoughtful stab at a cocktail list. We do agree service was a bit spotty, but in contrast to two other Sunday dining rooms that were empty this place was busy. And we all know Sunday restaurant labor is a bit pricey to find. So just order quick and think ahead for your next drink. Be proactive with your ordering and enjoy a busy restaurant. The kitchen rocks with a well timed wok and food comes quick and you just need to add your own lick! Chefs here definitely have their groove on. King of Sunday dining for us! Long live the Snake!",

The chicken was a blend of breast and thigh, which I typically don't prefer, but King of Snake must have chargrilled or roasted it for the most delectable flavor Overall, we were very pleased with the food scene in NZ, and King of Snake is an absolute must try.

As I was dining alone (on a business trip) it became apparent I would not be able to handle the two large entrees and a main. I politely requested that one of my untouched entrees be returned. Ionara proceeded to inform me in no uncertain terms that as I had ordered the meal, my options were to pay for it and take it away or leave it and still pay for it.

They tout that you can share the dishes which is true but you won't have any left overs. Now having eaten all types of Asian food from various countries it takes a lot to impress me. The curry vegetable dish ( $30) was really good, with a sweet savory flavor. The vegetables they chose for the curry ( pumpkin, baby corn, green beans, asparagus) are fresh and blend well with the curry. The other dish we ordered was the sirloin which was very tender but I felt did not stand out compared to other Asian dishes I've had for the price you pay. ($26) Overall, a good choice for dinner although you will pay for it.",

Modern, casual yet elegant is the definition of the interior. The oyster starters were just perfectly briny morsels that were contrasted well with the black pepper vinaigrette. This begged us to move on to the mandarin marinated tuna which in the hands of lesser cooks could be a textural disaster, but here it is firm yet infused well with the marinade, the pumpkin yellow curry was a wonderful amalgamation of thai flavors and a touch of Indianness with the cashews and the stir fried cumin lamb a fantastic meaty meal with bits of char on the lamb from the high heat stir fry working well with the toasty almost mild pungency of the cumin. This dish reminded me of a similar dish I had in Beijing and invoked a flood of memories of that trip, yet took me in a new direction. A nice wine list rounds off this place. I thought the Marlborough Gruner Vertliner to be a particularly good accompaniment to my food and quite well priced. Go go go to this place!!",

First off, the young waitress accidentally entered the wrong order in, we ordered the sushi+sashimi platter (as it had nigiri and miso soup), but were given the sashimi platter (35$ more expensive). The waitress had confirmed this order when we were ordering as there is only 1 miso soup and she asked if we wanted to order more as we had 3 people. We could tell she was very flustered with her mistake so was happy to pay for the wrong dish despite it being more expensive however asked if we could still get 1 miso soup and 1 rice as that's what was in the original order. The older waitress\/manager? then said she was happy to provide free miso but wanted to charge extra for 1 bowl of rice and hinted that it was our fault for not confirming the order when it arrived. Mid way during the meal a homeless woman walked in and tried to get a seat with the staff. When that didn't work she came to our table to try sit with us in the spare chair we had. I looked to the staff to try get some help and saw 4 of them just standing at the counter watching this happen. You are responsible for the safety of your guests that is in your establishment I am so disappointed.",

I also ordered udon which was good but I don't fancy shiitake mushrooms which made the broth less desirable. The noodles are thinner than normal and the portion is pretty small so I'd recommend complimenting it with a roll. The fried tuna roll was my least favorite order because it was hard to chew and mostly rice. My favorite was the kfc chicken. It was hot, moist, and crispy and all it needed was a little salt. Overall, I thought this place was satisfying and enjoyed my experience here. If you're looking for excellent service, decent sushi, and decent prices I'd have a seat.",

They did not offer much variety in rolls and when we asked for a spicy tuna roll, which is fairly common, we had to tell them what was in it.

What you are here for is the food which is amazing. We ordered a lot of food with the plan to place it in the middle and share it, allowing us to sample a good range. Our waitress seemed a bit shocked by how much we ordered and actually advised us to order less but we plowed ahead (in retrospect she was probably right..) Food comes out fresh as it is prepared and as such is always hot and perfectly cooked. It was all timed perfectly so that as one plate was finished, the next one was coming out. We started with edamame which is a classic we all enjoy. Highly recommend the deep fried takoyaki (octopus ball) which was incredible. I'd never had them before and we ordered it on the recommendation of my asian companions but would definitely get it again. The spider rolls (soft shell crab sushi) were another standout. Amazing taste and presentation. For mains the particular highlights were the K.F.C (we ordered a second plate of this), and the specials menu and sizzling dishes are well worth a look. The only dish we didn't enjoy was the eggplant gratin. We finished this meal extremely full and contented. Didn't look at the desert menu. Service is good and attentive but our waitress did forget to bring us any water during our meal. It can be expensive if you order a lot of dishes but well worth it for a special night out. I think we spent about $80 each, without alcoholic drinks included. Bottom line: for interesting, unique, and delicious Japanese food in Christchurch this is the place to come.",

It took over 50 minutes from when our booking was to be given the ordering sheet. It then was another 20 before we started seeing food brought out. Then after only 40 minutes of eating we were told our time was up and we had to put our last orders in. Koji is meant to be a great experience where you can slowly eat small portions over a longer period and have a great night and really appreciate the food. All we got to do was pay $75 to be rushed through my food. I didnt get a chance to order desert and overall it was a waste of money. I know I wasn't the only one at the birthday dinner left disappointed. . Can't say I recommend it based off that.",

I came across this restaurant with the highest charges in New Zealand, but the service and price were far from worth it. I really wanted to eat potato and pork rib soup, so I specifically took the bus. No one greeted me upon entering; I had to be the one to greet them and ask for the menu at the counter. The soup and kimchi were very salty, and I drank a lot of water. The soup had an excessive amount of oil, unlike what I've had in Korea. Although one of the servers said they were asking if I wanted more side dishes, that was the only good thing, as Korean restaurants generally offer free refills of appetizers, and the rice was also free. However, I was quite disappointed with the final bill because the surcharge was a hefty 2.91 NZD! I only ordered one serving of soup and rice, and while the price wasn't cheap, I could understand it in a foreign country. But this was the most expensive surcharge I've ever seen at a restaurant in New Zealand\u2026 In conclusion, it's not worth taking the bus just to eat here.",

There's also a Malaysian restaurant just outside. I've had very good burgers and pizza here, and I would definitely come again for those or to try more of the excellent-looking places. There's plenty of indoor and outdoor seating, but the large crowds here do mean that these fill up. This is especially true of the indoor area during the winter, but assorted heaters keep at least some of the outdoor tables mostly comfortable in the chill.

After waiting about 30 minutes for my order, I asked how long it would take and was told it was \"on it's way\", however about 10 minutes later, an employee approached me and asked what I had ordered. After telling her I ordered two waffles, she proceeded to look around and then come back only to say that they would get them started. About 10 minutes later I was handed a bag with the two waffles and the icecream, and when I opened it, there was no matcha. At this point I had waited 50 minutes for two $12 waffles and one of the orders wasn't even correct. The waffles also seemed undercooked and soggy. The employees were nice enough to add popcorn and some syrups because of how long we'd been waiting, but it definitely doesn't make up for everything. I understand that when working with food it is easy for orders to be forgotten and occasionally messed up but I'm just very sad. To boot, when not ordered takeaway, it comes with a waffle cone, but there was no waffle cone. It would just be nice to be told that there is no waffle cone if you order it take away. I am let down because all of my previous experiences at eightgrains have been wonderful, and after this I am unsure if I would return. :(",

The whole eatery is more like OFF an alley off High Street and is easily obscured by some taller buildings. Doesn't matter, FIND IT, it's worth it.

Nice flavor, decent amount of meat, and overall satisfying. But to be fair, the place has its ups and downs. Sometimes the quality just isn't quite there, sometimes the portion feels a bit small, and occasionally it's a bit too \"mono-protein\" - you know, mostly one type of meat and not much else. Still, when they get it right, it's a solid, comforting meal that hits the spot.",

When dishes started coming out well before all orders had been taken I asked the manager if we could have our orders taken faster. She was pretty rude and said no because they're busy. The food is delicious but the customer service is VERY poor. It's reasonably priced so in my opinion it's fine for take away but if you're trying to impress someone I wouldn't bring them here.

Speaking rudely about us, right in front of us (not realising one of us understood her language). We also overheard another table complaining about the same staff member's attitude, so it clearly wasn't just us. Thankfully, Suresh completely turned the experience around.

I apologized and paid with another card. I told him twice that the order was for takeaway, as I was unwell and my voice was faint. When the food was ready, it was served for dine-in. I reminded him again and asked him to pack it. He became unhappy and shouted at me: \"Calm down, calm down, I'll do it.\" When I said there was no need to shout, he then replied: \"What do you want to do, do you want to slap me?\" I'm very disappointed with my overall experience.

The flavourful soup was superb, and while the portion of noodles was generous, I found myself wanting more soup instead-especially after adding a note requesting no noodles. The kitchen went above and beyond and happily replaced the noodles with extra broth, and even surprised me with two cans of Pepsi. I really appreciated their attention to special instructions and the thoughtful extra touches. Fantastic service-will definitely be returning and highly recommend this place!",

The broth is light but flavorful, noodles are soft with a nice bite, and the chicken slices were tender. Perfect comfort food, especially if you've just landed or heading off on a trip.

Gave us a few great recommendations. Then gave us time to decide. We both went with a taco and appetizer. She then came back and asked if we were thinking about any cocktails. I asked what was on draft and they only had 2. Normally Mexican restaurants don't have very many so it was cool. She told us about both and I asked to taste one and she brought both drafts for tasting. It was very thoughtful cause I actually went with the one I didn't ask for. Once we got our food we started eating. And I'm telling you, the grilled chicken taco with mashed Avocado and pickled mango is one of the best tacos I've ever had. And I've had a lot of tacos. I fully recommend this place to anyone who loves Mexican food. I'm hoping to get there again before I leave New Zealand. It's only been 2 days. But maybe I'll get there today for lunch. Try them!

On a whim we searched Yelp and we're pleasantly surprised to find this place listed. After seeing the rating it was a no brainer. We started with the standard Margarita and although it was different from our normal it was very tasty (shaken not frozen). We wanted to taste a variety but we were late and their menu was limited for the evening crowd which made the difference between five stars and the four we gave them. Some of the photos posted made up our minds as to what we wanted but couldn't get it when we arrived around 7 pm. We ended up ordering the potatoes skins, fish taco, pulled pork and a chicken taco and if you like corn on the cob you gotta try theirs. Roasted corn on the cob covered in white cheese, may be parmessan, and some yummy spices. All the food was five stars and the service was great. They even have a great salsa that we see in Houston. Not our first choice but the fact that they had an authentic salsa sauce made in Mexico was a real sign of their authentic intentions and we salute them for that and their very tasty cuisine.

I also got guacamole ...home made and very good with salsa that was basically just fresh tomatoes with spices but still very good. My favorite part of the meal was the dessert! The caramel popcorn sundae! So freakin finger lickin good! Also had cotton candy on top! I highly recommend getting this. Also the cocktail list was very good. I got two different drinks and they were both very good. Only downside: there are no rice and beans. Being from Texas I'm like what kind of Mexican place has no rice!? Also hard to get any queso solo. Have to get it with other food. Overall great experience. Service was also good.",

Had a bit of an odd experience I think. First wait staff we encountered asked if we had a booking and when we said no (in an empty restaurant at 5pm) she looked concerned and said she'd have to direct is to the manager. He seemed as if it was no problem and told her we could use table 14 until 645. She then relayed that to us and asked if we would like her to go over the menu. We said sure and she basically read the whole thing. I think she was just a bit awkward, other staff seemed to interact with customers in a typical way. Not a big deal, just tainted our meal. My dad tried to mention it to the manager while paying but he was distracted and didn't hear.",

The tacos have soft shells, but have fruit in them (chicken & mango, pork & pineapple) which adds a really nice touch. The meat is juicy and delicious. I also tried the corn chips with salsa. The chips were plain with some salt on them, which lets you taste the nice corn flavour without any distraction like you would get with Doritos (not that I don't like Doritos). The salsa seemed like authentic pico de gallo, a fresh chunky salsa with citrus and coriander. I don't normally like fresh tomato or coriander, but I could eat this stuff for days. I also got a beef quesadilla, which was nice and cheesy. Not sure how else to describe it, but it was good. As for prices, you get pretty good value for money. The tacos are small, but I think they were around $7, which is not bad considering you would pay at least $5 at a food truck for something nowhere near as good. I can't remember how much everything else was, but if you get a couple of tacos and couple of other things to share, then you get a good meal for just over $20.",

The dining area is mostly tall top tables with some lower tables around the edges. I recommend the dining room as the service is much more attentive and efficient. Be sure to ask for sombreros to wear with dinner (no charge) or mustaches to take home ($2). The dining menu is more of a shared plate style atmosphere. For 5 people we ordered double tortillas (2\/pp), chicken, beef cheek, side coleslaw and seasonal veggies and were satisfied (granted we all had had snacks before we came). We also ordered 2 margaritas (the ginger: FANTASTIC and the Locos y Explosivo: delicious but VERY caliente!). Definitely an interesting dining experience as the theme seems to focus on Dios de las Muertas (Day of the Dead) and their food is very traditional Mexican. They also serve tacos, guacamole and salsas and other options if you're not comfortable with the shared plates concept. Definitely recommend checking this place out if you're craving Mexican!",

Just be careful as they do have dining windows and you may be evicted from your seat before you are ready as they will have the table booked for someone else. I don't mind this, as long as you are warned when you make your reservation. In my most recent experience (staff xmas party) we were made to give up our seats before dessert, while people were still contemplating ordering more main dishes, which left a sour taste in everyones mouth. The food is pretty good but does come in small sizes. You will often need at least two dishes to actually start to feel full. The guac is ok, and I really like the crispy potato skins. The larger dishes are all pretty good with strong flavours. I always try and get a taco (favourite so far is the pulled pork), and a larger dish such as the ceviche or the chicken\/chorizo sticks. The braised beef and pork hock are pretty good as well. And of course, some fried chicken for the table. No dish really stands out as a absolute must have, and none are particularly bad either. Mexicanos is noisy, and dark. The atmosphere is very cool but its not a place for quiet conversations. The drinks list is pretty limited if you are after wine but has a good selection of margarita's and sangria.",

We went to Mexicanos at about 9:30pm on a Saturday and struggled to get a table. Initially we sat outside but were soon told that they stopped serving alcohol outside at 10pm. Inside we went. The food reminds me a bit of the Mexico chain but perhaps a bit more 'traditional.' We had the usual guac followed by an array of soft shell tacos ($8). Unlike Mexico , the filling were generous and the meat well-cooked. They could of done with more fresh herbs but that was only a slight niggle.

The food comes out as it's ready, and dishes are great for sharing. This works out well for a long meal, except that our noodles came out about 20 minutes after the rest of the food (and we were about ready to leave). We ended up taking that whole dish to go (takeaway) after it was served. My personal favorite was the chili fish -- the broth was spicy and delicious -- but everything on the menu was great!",

For drinks, I ordered coke and a oreo milkshake. The milkshake came in a little mason jar, and oreo flavor was diluted with milk, so was pretty mid. For food I ordered the Monster Platter which includes 2 choice of fried chicken (garlic and parmesan), 4 garlic bread, potato fries, cabbage salad, aioli and monster pickle. The chicken was delicious and flavorful and all the sides complimented each other. The only criticism I had was the pickle wasn't chilled, came out room temperature.

The fish was good with generous spices at that time. So went back had screwers in pot, didn't like it as it was quite pale, ingredients weren't really quality, this was back in Feb. Thought I'd give another go, tried bbq today. They were a bit dry, not enough flavours. We trusted the lady said that's all you ordered. Then after left, we realised they missed at least 2 things. So if you do go there, make sure they've got all you ordered. Worth to check by yourselves. There is not much service now at this place, probably they are getting more tours, no time to look after small group customers. Takes longer to serve, the place is quite loud with people from tours yelling at each other. Thought they'd do good in Christchurch, quite disappointed and definitely not going back.",

The pieces of mixed sushi were decent. I was told the 2 rice balls I chosed were crispy chicken & that's what we wanted. But the crispy chicken within tasted like just the crumb coating & only bits of shredded chicken mixed thru. Thought I might have just been unlucky with the first rice ball but the other one we took home was the same. A whole lot of rice & about slightly over a tablespoon of chopped up crumbs. Hope this is not what people are paying full price for. Even though I got what was the end of the day sale...it felt like a total rip off with the crumbs. Ate a lot of crispy chicken rice balls elsewhere but none of them were like these ones. Really strange, baffled & kids really disappointed!

The eel nigiri was the star - tender and coated in sweet sauce, totally restaurant-quality. Ate it straight from the car - quick, easy, and super satisfying. No wait, no fuss. Just grab and go.

Fear Not - this place is not one that requires reservations a month in advance. Show up and be ready for your taste buds to go on an adventure way more exciting than Frodo's Trip to Mordor! *IF YOU DONT LIKE SPICY FOODS - READ THE MENU CAREFULLY* This place packs the heat!! Foe those crazy souls still down to test your mouths limits, you've come to the right place. As soon as you walk in, you'll smell the charcoal burning that's smoking the meats right in front of you. This place makes your dish fresh to order - no hidden microwaves in the back. Every bite I had was better than the last. Tandodi Chicken Wings were smokey, salty, and spicy. Use the lemon wedge provided to give that extra acidity and really take this dish over the edge. Kadai Chicken was thick, complex, tender, and spicy! It was not as sauce-heavy as a butter chicken, but there was enough sauce to be great over rice. We also ordered the Garlic Naan and it was a perfect addition. Green Apple Pickle - I wasn't sure about this at first, but I'm so glad we got this side dish. I enjoy spicy food, but I'm no wildfire warrior that can swallow spice without grimace. These Apple bits were the perfect palate cleanser and really reset my mouth before each dish. Still crunchy, and slightly tart, the apples were refreshing and crisp - a welcome reprieve for a mouth slowly catching on fire. Overall, this place was INCREDIBLE, probably some of the best Indian Food I've ever had (not lucky enough to make it to India yet).",

The vindaloo chicken wings blew me away with their tenderness and flavour. The butter chicken (yes, I know, bog standard) was some of the best I've tasted anywhere. I must ding them for one small thing, though, the \"naan chips\" were nearly indistinguishable from the crispy noodles served in Chinese restaurants in the States with egg drop soup. Even with this, I can't deduct any stars, the rest of the meal was just too good. Really well done, Mumbaiwala.",

Our server took the our orders another 30 mins later and by the time we got our food, there was another hour's delay. In their defense, our visit was on a Sat evening and they were definitely very busy. Also, I have to say that our server did everything possible to make it up to us. He gave us one of the appetizers complimentary as well as gave us an discount on the bill.

The same sentiments are from customers -Vijay Shekhar - Husahnpreet Kaur The behavior of the owner exactly mimics the name of the restaurant \"mumbaiwala\" Which basically depicts street person with no customer centricity.Very arrogant and rude . No manners on how to deal with customers. The owner has Absolutely no idea about being customer focus This person Needs to stay in Mumbai rather than in a place like Christchurch I had very good impression about people in NZ during my Trip so far but this owner really puts a black spot on my total impression Having said that my 99% experience in NZ was just fantastic. I am so so so glad that we left the restaurant without eating their and then were suggested one of the best Indian restaurants in Christchurch called Coriander. Thanks for the owners arrogance and his Mumbai tone , I will definitely not be recommending mumbaiwala to anybody in USA and being in field of public relations can at-least help over few thousand people to stay away from this restaurant and arrogant \/ rude behavior of the owner. My rating is -5 as I believe that if you cannot be good to your customers you should not be in the business of serving people If anybody needs any more information Pl ping me and I will respond .",

Vomiting, stomach cramps, nausea etc. The 5 of us who fell ill were the 5 who ate the prawns. The one person who did not get sick, had the chicken. I would not have given a 1 star review had the restaurant responded differently to our email letting them know we all got sick. Their response \"The staff also ate the prawns and did not get sick\".

A bowl of simple roast potatoes that were undercooked on the inside with a sparse amount of bland sauce and a bowl of nearly plain lettuce leafs. One of the dishes we received from the menu was the focaccia which was delicious but we got one small piece each which again doesn't seem worth the money (on the menu the focaccia is $13 so i assume that ordering it not as part of trust the chef you would receive a more generous portion) We calculated how much it would have cost to order all the dishes we wanted from the menu and it would've actually worked out cheaper than doing trust the chef. We were also never told and it does not say on the menu that dessert was included in trust the chef (it became clear to us that this would be the 4th course when the 3rd course delivered was the main) there were no desserts listed on the menu given us. Two issues here - the main one being that I wouldn't have ordered dessert and therefore didn't factor this in to the cost of our decision and I didn't eat it. Secondly the dessert given was very small - about a 1\/5th portion of a normal slice of cake with a mini scoop of gelato. Again poor value for money. (but at least my partner could easily consume both given the size) In saying this - the beef main we were given was delicious, the drinks were good, the service was excellent and the vibe of the restaurant is lovely. Our issue really is the value for money of the trust the chef and the poor reflection of the trust the chef compared to the menu - definitely give Odeon a try but my recommendation would be to order off the menu over doing the trust the chef.",

        "text":"The Sottilette rolled pizza base with napoli sauce, Wairiri buffalo burrata and fresh basil was tasty and delicious. The NZ Southern Stations wagyu was cooked to medium to medium well instead of the medium rare I asked for, and was a little under seasoned. But it did have a nice chargrilled sear. The black garlic pur\u00e9e tasted burnt and the texture was very grainy. For $45 dollars, the dish felt incomplete. The Pappardelle al rag\u00f9 di cervo, braised venison rag\u00f9 with juniper and thyme, finished with berries and cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche looked amazing and the fruit gave the rich sauce some welcome, acidic respite. Unfortunately the pasta and the sauce were severely lacking seasoning. It was interesting that the restaurant styles itself as an Italian inspired eatery but there was no Italian wine on offer. Not to worry though, as the Mt Difficulty Pinot Noir was a fine accompaniment to all the dishes. Where things really went off the rails was the level of service we received or didn't receive. When our starter was finished, our plates and cutlery were not cleared before the main came out out. There was no cutlery for the main at all, including the rather essential steak knife. We had to approach the bar staff in order to find some wait staff to then get us what we needed to eat our dishes. The server who attended to us was very apologetic and rectified the issue straight away, and even asked us if we'd like more drinks or desserts --- something we had yet to be asked by the other staff who had previously attended us. When it was time to pay, the front of house staff member who collected the bill did not think to ask how we found the meal and we left rather disappointed overall.",

It might be because there was too little pepper or ginger, which didn't suppress the fishy smell of the pork. The chicken feet were okay, but there was a taste that was not the traditional black bean sauce chicken feet. It was acceptable, but not a big fan.

The staff are always so lovely and welcoming, truly the heart of a perfect pub. The joy that comes from warm lighting, classic brick walls, and the gorgeous doggies that sit at the feet of their owners just enjoying a night at the pub - truly couldn't ask for anything better. The menu is and always has been the best! Perfectly cooked steaks and the most delicious cauliflower burgers!

They were still warm, so I don't believe it was a delivery issue. We only managed to eat a few of the 16 before giving up. I've sent an email and a follow-up with no response.

When I saw dumpling bar, it was like my prayers have been answered! We ordered so much food! Pork 'n' Garlic Chive Dumplings, Pork 'n' Ginger and Spring Onion Dumplings, Pork Belly Bao Bun, Beijing Duck Bao Bun, Pork & Prawn Shumai, Steamed Asian Greens, and PSDB Signature Xiaolongbao. I was soooooooo excited for our food. But then, a few items came out, we stuffed our faces, and then the food just stopped. It took a very long while for the rest of our food to come out. Turns out they forgot about the rest of our orders. I was pretty frustrated (but still patient) at the time, and the server was very apologetic about the wait. They even gave us a cucumber salad for free. When I finally got the check, they took off about \u00be of our bill - most of the dumplings and even our drinks. So, in the end, we left as happy campers with full bellies. Would I come back? Absolutely! The food was phenomenal.",

        "text":"We are Asian Americans who were on the last leg of our honeymoon when we came upon this place. Let's just say I was longing for some Asian food after feeling like I smelled like a New Zealand lamb from eating so much of it. Dumplings sounded like an amazing idea. I knew I wasn't supposed to expect much.. First thing I noticed. We were the only Asians in the place when we walked in. Hm.. hope that doesn't mean anything.. Second thing, The place is kind of dark, like they are trying to make eating Chinese dumplings a cool, hip, bad-boy, thing to do. Strange, but okay. I didn't like the weird eerie dark background music with random Chinese going on. Eerie, very eerie. Now what about the food? Food was good. The dumplings (fried) were nice and crispy, though as another reviewer said, kind of an interesting style I hadn't had before. The steamed dumplings were not bad as well. The xiao long bao was good, but the skin was not as thin as I like (It's not DIN TAI FUNG, k guys?). They ran out of duck :( so we also got the pork belly \"burger\" ... that was good, crispy pork deliciousness, and kind of funny. It's basically bigger than your average pork belly open faced bun (IDK how to say it in English), so they call it a burger! Also, the service, was, really, not there. I would have given them higher stars if they had been a little, LITTLE more attentive. We were waiting for so long sitting at the table with our menu that I started to wonder if we were supposed to go to the counter to order?? Genuinely! We weren't.. ? We also were given no napkins to start with. We asked for a refill on water and it came the first time, but the second time, it didn't come. --Bottom line, it was good for a dumpling craving coming from California, but it was more expensive than what we were used to and we didn't like the bar feel.--",

        "text":"On our way out of Christchurch, we stopped at Pot Sticker to grab a quick bite. I have to say that their website is quite clear about their enthusiasm about dumplings, and the storefront - with a lot of manga art around the front - is similarly reflective of the affinity for Asian culture. Placing our order was relatively quick, and after a ~7-10 minute wait, we sat down at the bar surrounding the restaurant, we started chowing down. The one upshot here is that the meat filling, particularly the pork, is much higher-quality stuff than your usual generic pork meat that gets stuffed in dumplings. The flavor of the pork is very good, and I really liked the flavor of the winter warmer dumplings. Unfortunately, the technique was not up to snuff, detracting away from the overall experience. The wrapper on the steamed dumpling was a bit rubbery, making each bite a tad strange. The fried dumpling was even more puzzling; it appears that all that is done is taking a steamed dumpling and having it sit in a skillet covered with a thin film of frying oil. All this served to do was give the outer edges a crisp, but since they were steamed, it made them extremely dry. In short - while the filling is pretty top-notch, the wrapper and cooking technique of the dumpling fell a bit short of what I would expect in my favorite dumplings. If they could perfect that, along with doing a true fried dumpling (e.g. don't steam them, then attempt to fry them - just throw the whole thing on the skillet and give it a good oily crisp on the bottom) - this would definitely get a marked-up rating from me.",

Slosh goes the oil, in goes the pot-stickers until they start to brown, then comes the scoop of hot water and down goes the bamboo lid!

I spent a year in Napier where there are no decent dumplings to be found for love or money so it was such a relief to return to Christchurch and discover Pot Stickers a mere 100m from my work. Don't expect to find any food here but dumplings but thats ok because they are exceptional. There are generally about 4-5 different flavours, and they do vege tuesday. The beef and beetroot is surprisingly spectacular (I had my doubts) and my personal favourite is the classic pork and coriander. Your options are 6\/12\/18 steamed or fried. Be prepared to wait if you want fried as its always busy. Steamed is faster. I go for the \"dozen matter\" which offers a selection of all the flavours, and yes you can get 6 of the dozen matter if you are just after a snack. These dumplings are exploding with flavour, packed full of filling, and perfectly cooked. There is a window that looks into the kitchen so you can see the dumpling chefs hard at work while waiting for your meal. I come here at least once a week and can recommend it wholeheartedly.",

They offer 5 flavors (4 are always the same, one changes) and you can order them by the 1\/2 or dozen. I prefer to order the \"Dozen Matter\" where you can get whichever dumplings you want. My favorite flavors are Garlic Pork and Chive (staple) the Vegetarian option (staple) or Beefroot (speciality: beef + beetroot). They also have chicken dumplings, too. There are 3 sauces to choose from (or get all three) chili, vinegar, soy. You can ask for them to be extra hot if you'd like (as someone who can't stand heat, the chili does have a bite). There is seating in the mall, both at a large communal table and on stools against the dumpling joint. I love sitting at the stools because you can watch the dumplings being made, which provides entertainment while you wait (at least 10 minutes from order time). Street parking is definitely hard to find, and you will need to find a spot longer than 30 minutes. This is not a quick \"in and out\" option as the dumplings are cooked to order. I definitely recommend driving out of your way to have lunch here. You will not be disappointed as these are some of the best dumplings I have had (outside of New York City)!",

Experience 2: Ordered mysore masala, waited for 45 mins, still staff was serving everyone else but not even answering to us for the delay. We asked them to cancel the order as it was taking too long. They didn't cancel the order. At the end we left after 50 minutes. Experience 3: politely requested staff to get the table cleaned, got replied very rudely to keep calm.

The food has always been good in the past - but this time was such a disappointing experience that we won't be returning. We ordered through Uber Eats, and the fish that arrived was extremely cold, stale, and clearly not fresh - completely inedible. We called the restaurant to inform them, and the person on the phone casually said, \"Just microwave it for 2 minutes bro.\" We explained that we had paid for fresh food, but he insisted it was made fresh \"today,\" which is already concerning for seafood. When we questioned the freshness, he said he'd bring new fish to \"see who's lying,\" but he never showed up. It's really disappointing to see how the quality and customer service have declined. We used to love this place, but after this experience, we'll unfortunately never order from Potichor again.",

The ramen was also very good with good flavors in the broth. The pork chasu was cut very thick. The condiments on the table was also labeled. There was also suggestions on how to flavour your ramen.

        "text":"A memorable and mouthwatering experience at Rangoon Ruby I had the pleasure of dining at Rangoon Ruby on Colombo Street in Christchurch, thanks to a thoughtful recommendation-and invitation-from a friend originally from Burma. What a delightful discovery. The restaurant's interior is simply stunning. Modern touches blend seamlessly with traditional Burmese details-from the intricately designed menu on the wall and the colorful umbrellas adorning the ceiling, to the striking mural of Burmese women gracing the back wall. It creates a welcoming and culturally rich atmosphere. From the moment we stepped inside, the hospitality was exceptional. The hostess greeted us with genuine warmth, and we were pleasantly surprised when the Chef and members of the kitchen staff came out to say hello. Our waiter was equally impressive-friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable about the menu. Now, the food. Every dish was a standout. The seafood was perfectly cooked, infused with delicate yet vibrant flavours. The beef curry was melt-in-your-mouth tender, no knife required. I couldn't get enough of the Tea Leaf Salad-I nearly finished the entire thing myself. We ended on a high note with a dessert that tasted like a comforting blend of warm rice pudding and sponge cake, paired with fresh fruit and cream. All in all, Rangoon Ruby offers a truly special dining experience-flavourful, heartfelt, and beautifully executed. It's an absolute must-try.",

I found just that at a humble Chinese restaurant in Christchurch - and the best part? It was only $10. Here's what I had today: \u2022 Mapo Tofu - Silky soft tofu with a light kick of spice and that signature numbing flavor. Not too oily, super comforting, and perfect with rice. \u2022 Stir-fried Celery with Pork - Crisp celery and tender pork slices cooked simply but full of wok hei - tasted just like home cooking. \u2022 Braised Beef Brisket with Potato - The beef was melt-in-your-mouth tender, and the potato soaked up all that rich, savory sauce. It honestly felt like something that had been simmering for hours in a family kitchen. Served with a generous portion of steamed white rice, the whole meal felt hearty, warm, and deeply satisfying. No frills, just honest-to-goodness food that reminds you of a meal back home. If you're in Christchurch and craving a real Chinese lunch that doesn't break the bank, this spot is a hidden gem. The dishes change daily too - so there's always something new to try.",

The atmosphere is intimate and cozy. It felt like I was going to an Aunts house for dinner. The waiter was so pleasant. He didn't miss a beat and did everything to ensure my friend and I were well taken care of. His hospitable personality is a big reason why I would go back again. I got the phallow which is like a pork belly stew. It was super tasty! I loved the richness and depth of the flavours. Only thing I would change is the chunks of black cardamon throughout the dish- Instead I'd find a way make it more evenly spread. We bought our own bottle of wine along as This is a licensed BYO restaurant. Notably, there is an $8 fee corkage fee per bottle of wine you bring to the venue",

        "text":"a good noodle house, with an open kitchen, large menu and good prices. They are known for throwing in complementary chicken bones that were used to make their broth. It's an interesting touch that I've not seen from other places, and made it a worthwhile stop during our visit to Christchurch. My brother and I learned about this place from a staff member at the Hyatt Regency in Sydney, who let us know that this was one of her favorite places to go when back home in Christchurch (especially for the chicken bones). So we decided to center our day around visiting it, once we got off the ship on a Thursday. It's more than 3 km from the centre of Christchurch, so a decent trek, but was able to take a bus back after a filling meal. It also brought us to the Riccarton neighborhood. If there is a 'Chinatown' in Christchurch, the Riccarton neighborhood is probably it. There were a ton of places that we passed, that we would also try out if we had time. The restaurant opens at 11 and was already fairly busy when we stopped in around that time. It is an open kitchen, staffed by two ladies. As one can imagine, they were very busy but were still very friendly and patient to answer our questions. We learned that they will throw in the chicken bones with any purchase. The menu itself is not specific to Cambodia but is a mixture. I was really craving noodle soup, so ended up getting three dishes along with an app to share between the two of us. #7 Noodles Soup with Chicken (NZ$17) - the better of the two soups, it used the flavorful broth from all that chicken bone braising. You have your choice of thick or thin rice noodles, and they give you plenty. I enjoyed nibbling on the chicken bones, trying to find those missed meat morsels. #9 Beef Noodles Soup (NZ$18.50) - I thought this was OK. The broth was very clean and it did come with uniform strips of food grade quality beef, and a lot of rice noodles. Shrimp Pad Thai (off menu) - (NZ$ 25) - This was an OK rendition, with a decent amount of well-cooked shrimp. Deep fried spring rolls (NZ$9.50) - Both of us really liked this dish, using whole seasoned shrimp, wrapped in spring roll paper to resemble miniature cones. They were freshly deep fried and were delicious, coming with a sweet Thai chili sauce. They market themselves as a noodle house specializing in Chinese and Thai favorites, but also with a Cambodian flair. With their large portions and reasonable prices, free wifi for customers, and friendly hospitality, Riccarton Noodle House is a good stop for locals and tourists, alike.",

        "text":"Second last dinner in Christchurch. We were debating between a few spots in Riccarton but ended up choosing Riccarton Noodle House, a Cambodian spot. It's more like a mix of Vietnamese, Cambodian and Malaysian. We dropped in on a Tuesday evening (around 7:00pm) and it was empty. The inside has a bit of Cambodia decoration (Angkor Wat painting on the wall) but other than that, it's bare. Service is non-existent. You go to the counter to order where you also can grab water and utensils (self serve). The menu is up above the open style kitchen; special spicy, noodle soup, satay, stir fry noodles, specials, side dishes and sweets. - Curry laksa with chicken (#31) ($13.00 NZD) - I can never say no to laksa but in hindsight, this was a poor choice. Laksa isn't a Cambodian speciality; should have got one of their noodle soups instead. The laksa was half decent but nowhere close to being authentic. Barely any ingredients inside and they used udon noodles... - Black pepper udon with seafood (#30) ($15.00 NZD) - we asked for claypot yee-mee and got this. No idea how the chef messed up our order. We decided to eat it but should have complained instead. Super stingy on the seafood (only a couple small pieces of squid and three prawns). The pepper was overpowering and vegetables consisted of the cheap, bland variety. Bad, just bad. One of the most disappointing meals of our trip. I was still hungry afterwards. 2.5 stars.",

My nephew and I ordered the lunch special to go, comes with choice of curry and comes with rice and Naan bread. He got mild butter chicken and I got hot lamb Rogan Josh. Both consumed within minutes as soon as got home. The spice of my Rogan Josh was expectedly hot, wishing it could go hotter. Naan was hot and fresh. Will come again for sure. Edit: visited here again last weekend (Sat 1st Nov 2025) and the food was just as exceptional. Instead of takeaway we dined in this time round; ordered entrees onion bhaji and samosas with complimentary sauces, they were filling and tasty, with just right level of spice. Mains were lamb korma and lamb Rogan Josh, both spicy and delicious. Service was attentive and excellent, can't recommend this place enough. Six stars",

From the moment you walk in, you're greeted with the comforting aroma of spices and a team that treats you like family. The ambience is relaxed yet vibrant, perfect for a casual dinner or a celebratory feast. What sets Saffron Spice apart? Consistency. Their biryani is a personal favourite,fragrant, generous, and packed with flavour. And if you're into heat, the vindaloo delivers a satisfying kick without overpowering the dish. Service is always prompt and friendly, with staff happy to guide you through the menu or tweak spice levels to suit your taste. It's the kind of place where you feel looked after, not just served. Whether I'm grabbing a quick takeaway or settling in for a slow meal with friends, Saffron Spice never disappoints. It's my go-to spot in Hornby when I want food that's bold, comforting, and unmistakably Indian.",

Didn't get popcorn chicken. Was chicken nuggets and some weird corn nuggets. Wilted salad greens on side. The pancake was crunchy hard and bland. The seafood pho was terrible. The broth was super sweet but that is the only flavour you got. No lemon or accompaniments to go with it. Not even a lemon wedge to squeeze in to it. Grilled pork and spring roll vermicelli salad was probably the better dish. Their nuoc cham was already mixed in which isn't what im used to. Not enough spice or fish sauce. Fried rice not much to say. The wait for food is long. Our friends starter came out probably 15 minutes before ours",

The chef wasn't just going through the motions, he was lovingly preparing our order. Attention to detail and care were evident. I've had top notch Vietnamese and paid top $ for it. It was next level. This by contrast is humble food done brilliantly. I would totally recommend it.",

        "text":"Honestly, quite disappointed with the overall experience. The food was way below average compared to other restaurants, especially considering their higher prices. The curry had an unusually strong color, which made it look artificial, and the taste was almost bland. What really stood out was the hospitality - it felt noticeably friendlier toward local customers than towards us. No one even asked how the food was, and most of the attention seemed focused on impressing the locals. To add, this wasn't our first odd experience here. A few years ago, we walked in and were told there were no tables available unless we had a booking. Just out of curiosity, my wife called them right after we stepped out, and suddenly, they said a table was available. When we went back in, they realized their mistake and apologized, but the whole situation felt quite uncomfortable - almost as if they didn't really want us there in the first place. Overall, not a place I'd return to or recommend. There are plenty of restaurants around offering much better food, value, and respect for all customers. Update on your response Thank you for your response. I understand you may see things differently, but I've simply shared my honest experience as a paying customer. It's disappointing that instead of taking the feedback constructively, the reply came across as defensive and personal. Also, thank you for taking the time to look into my Facebook account to find my mutual friends - that level of effort says a lot in itself. Regardless of what your internal notes or assumptions might say, my experience at the table didn't feel welcoming - and as a customer, that's what matters most. Feedback is meant to help improve service, not start a debate or a personal investigation. I wish your team the best and hope future customers have a better experience.",

I ordered mapo tofu which you had to pay extra for rice--if it's a dish that you're supposed to eat with rice, just give the customer rice. I would understand paying separate for rice if I ordered like a noodle dish but it should just come included! So I rolled my eyes at that. But wait, it gets worse. Worst mapo tofu ever. Not completely inedible but when you use the frozen veggies for the carrots and peas but can't find a package that doesn't include corn so you just throw in the corn as well... China would be embarrassed. Not sure if it was from the froze. Veggies but the texture of the sauce should be more gelatinous rather than liquid and it was all just liquid with meh flavor. If I spend any more time in this city I would never come back here. Not worth my money.",

I found a small cafe with sandwiches and a bar only serving take away items, but that's it. This and a South American restaurant were the only places open at the time! I ordered the mini spring rolls and deep fried crumbed prawns ($20.50 total). Both were pretty bad. The spring rolls hardly had anything in them, and they were so hard they hurt my teeth, which rarely happens. The prawns were VERY greasy without any flavor. I only ate a couple. At least they had jasmine tea to cut the grease! I've definitely eaten better in the USA at countless restaurants, hence the \"experienced better\" rating. The waitresses were more interested in chatting than serving. Since I've an American accent, they assumed I only wanted silverware (no chopsticks placed on the table) despite being Chinese. Since so few places are open for full food service from 3-5PM, there's no reason to be good, right?",

According to recent news reports and comments, the labour laws are violated, staff were unfairly treated or even forced to take unpaid breaks during rostered hours, and even more worrying, the owner was caught selling recalled products that should have been removed from shelves for safety reasons. This seriously puts customers' health at risk. The food quality is also not authentic compared to proper Japanese ramen. For example, the \"spicy miso ramen\" uses Chinese chilli oil instead of Japanese seasoning, which is far from traditional flavour. It's also unusual to see some new 5-star reviews recently, which strongly makes me question the accuracy of the ratings. To be clear, this review is only about the Colombo St branch. The Samurai Bowl on Wairakei Road is very different - their ramen is authentic and much closer to Japanese standards, and I would recommend dining there instead.",

Atmosphere was a 3 purely because it's in Eastgate mall and not the nicest place to sit around. I got a Tikka Masala and a Garlic & Cheese Naan to takeaway. The food was really nice! A lot nicer than I expected it to be. They didn't ask me for my preferred spice level - like most Indian restaurants do, but maybe it's different due to the foodcourt setup? This meant the Tikka Masala was a tad spicy for me, but I still eagerly finished it. The portion sizes are a little on the smaller side but I don't eat much so it was perfect for me! I got lots of chicken pieces and the chicken was nice and tender too. Perfectly cooked, thank you! Beautiful and friendly staff and I would happily return. $21 for Curry with rice and a drink.",

There were no staff at your counter when I used the bell that's provided for service Instead of two friendly faces coming to the front I got one guy I recognised who didn't say anything and one guy I didn't recognise snapping at me to wait a moment. They both disappeared round back and I never saw them again. Two women who were sitting came up to me and said they did the same thing and got a nasty response. Lucky for me they recommended the guys right next to your counter and they were fantastic friendly and the sweet soy chicken was delicious. I know that you won't care you didn't get my money but I'm glad you didn't and won't get any of my dollars again. It's not hard to be respectful to people especially those who support your business.

The other night I came with my friends, and one of us had dietary requirements which I made it clear to the waitress during ordering - she was Muslim. I spoke in Mandarin Chinese so there's no way she heard me incorrectly. Since we didn't want to risk meat, we ordered from the \"Vegetables\" section on the ordering IPad. Now, I've never personally ordered from this tab because my family are meat lovers so I thought these were all completely vegeterian dishes. On the IPad ordering system there's also nothing indicating what has meat and what doesn't. Now I understand that the waitress probably thought the eggplants were for the rest who wasn't Muslim so she didn't say anything but I don't understand why a dish with meat would be in the vegetable section. They should make it that more clear with labels on every dish on what's vegeterian and what isn't for any future vegetarians\/vegans\/muslims. However, I do have to say that the waitress did do a nice job defusing the situation, she allowed us to order another dish and this time walked us through what's ACTUALLY vegetarian in the vegetable section and changed my friend's rice, plates, cutleries, etc. We also had no issues with their other dishes. But again, I'd advise all vegetarians\/vegans\/muslims to be careful while ordering and understand that their \"vegetable\" section isn't vegetarian until they change that, or just go to a different Chinese restaurant to be safe. :)",

No place has better service than Simply Delicious Taste of India! I absolutely love curry, especially Indian rice (yes, I'm obsessed with rice!). Everywhere I go, the rice portions are usually small (I'm not a big naan eater), but here they kindly gave me extra rice - and even offered us a mango lassi to try, which I'll never forget. What an incredibly delicious drink! I couldn't recommend this place more. The food is fantastic, the staff are wonderful, and the whole experience was just perfect.

We asked the guys leaving the restaurant how was the food and their quick response were that the food was very good. We glanced the menu quickly. We decided to make it easy for two of us and ordered a platter for two. We did not have lunch but still could not finish all the meat and the fries. Our comment is that be prepared to be hungry for platter for two. A staff came and offered a box; relatively friendly and good service. The sausage was good. Meat was tender; it would be better if we could taste a bit more smoky on the meat. Overall it was good food and tasted good with hands and figures.

        "text":"Just discovered this humble ramen spot - Soshite Hikari, and it's quickly become my go-to budget-friendly comfort food place, especially during the start (and end!) of the month. They specialize in affordable, clean-tasting, and light ramen, and even have $10 lunch specials on weekdays! \u2e3b Transparent Pricing, Super Wallet-Friendly \u2022 Signature ramen is only $12.8 - easily one of the most affordable bowls in Christchurch \u2022 $10 weekday lunch specials with great variety - and no, they're not just filler dishes! Light Broth, Springy Noodles I ordered the seafood ramen, and the broth was unexpectedly light and non-greasy. It's that kind of clean, refreshing soup that won't leave you thirsty afterward. The noodles were perfectly cooked with a nice bounce, and the toppings included fresh shrimp, half a marinated egg, greens, and wakame seaweed. Great value for the price! No free noodles, but free soup refills! If you're a broth lover like me, this is a huge plus. The free soup refill makes the whole meal feel extra satisfying and cozy. The $10 Lunch Specials Are a Hidden Gem Their rice bowl lunch sets are just $10 and perfect for a quick and filling midday meal. The portion is decent too - definitely enough to keep you going through the afternoon. Their takeaway packaging is adorable! The ramen comes in a pull-tab container that looks like a drink can. Super cute, totally Instagram-worthy, and still keeps the soup hot - love that fun detail! \u2e3b Who I'd Recommend This To: \u2022 Anyone who loves ramen but prefers it on the lighter, less salty side \u2022 Students or office workers looking for a solid meal without breaking the bank \u2022 People who enjoy clean, simple flavors and unique presentation styles \u2e3b Verdict: Soshite Hikari doesn't go for flashy gimmicks, but wins your heart with honest pricing and gentle, satisfying broth. Whether you're a local or a traveler on a budget, this spot is definitely worth checking out!",

So I was so disappointed to be so late, but their friendliness lifted me back up after quite a stressful afternoon. Their food is truly amazing. We had the southern fried chicken and charred broccolini as entrees. They were delicious. We both had steaks as mains and it was just so good.

The papadoms tasted like the ones from the supermarket and the pickled mango tasted off. Our samosas that we ordered were soft and obviously a bit old.

Drinks order taken promptly and served. 2 large pizzas and Spags chips ordered when drinks delivered. About 30 minutes later the waitress asked if we wanted anything else. We reminded her of the 2 pizzas and chips. She had NOT placed our order with the kitchen. 5 min and the chips arrived. Another 10 - 15 minutes and we had our pizza. This delay over shadowed the meal which was ok. Venison pieces were sparse and chewy. Chips were great but could be because we were getting quite hungry. We ended up 20mins late for our 8pm concert.

One customer decided to leave after hearing her meal would take another 30mins. At this point I was having doubts. Please note, the restaurant was not full. Only half the seating was occupied. After about 10mins, we were still not attended to. That's ok, I assumed that it's order at the counter. Went up to the counter to place my order. There was one person in front of me. He was there when we walked in. After he made his order, I stood in front of the counter. Waited. And waited and waited. What seemed like 7 or 8 mins. No staff even looked in my direction or acknowledge that I was present. I walked out. Never would I ever come back. Edit: Thanks for your response. I noticed the new staff. But I was ignored by all your staff. I was willing to wait. But will not tolerate being ignored by all that worked there.",

The beef in the fried rice was so tender. The sweet and sour pork was still a little bit crunchy which was lovely, with a perfectly balanced sweet but tangy sauce, and delicious won tons too.

A lot of it is prepared and refrigerated. For example their crumbed food. This makes it not crispy and has a stale, soft texture to it. Even though they call it crispy chicken or crispy prawn. They are frequently out of simple ingredients. INCLUDING RICE! What sushi shop runs out of rice. Their kitchen closes really early. Used to be 2pm then 1:45pm and now 1:30pm. Which seems silly as that is lunch time. And the kitchen is fully closed on a Sunday. I've given up on this sushi shop.",

I have been doing this since you opened. Twice now I have been told off by the same woman who tells me I cannot use my loyalty card as it doesnt cover the cabinet sushi. The cards says, \"all sushi over $10\". Over the very multiple times I visit, the service is fantastic, so friendly, except this woman who has only served me twice. Today, I was scolded and told off in front of customers I was wrong and if I wanted to use my loyalty card it was only boxed sushi. I pointed out it says \"all sushi\" again she told me I was wrong, shook her head and was insulting me in her language. I have learnt a few expressions.",

Phad Thai was extremely spicy for a medium which wouldn't usually bug me but I have severe indigestion so needed a maximum of medium. And it was literally just over cooked spicy mush and I gave up eating it not even a third of the way through. Roti was cold and stale- reminded me of stale pie pastry rather than the classic Thai roti I was craving... very disappointing. Green curry was okay ish, but still disappointed again as I've often made a lot better myself.

I also got a prawn pad thai and was more of a seafood peanut satay pad thai, it was very peanutty the noodles weren't you're normal thick pad thai noodles they were very thin. The curry puffs were like curry mash wrapped in pastry. I asked for fresh sping rolls and was given fried spring rolls. The service itself was okay communication barrier was a little difficult as we both struggled to understand each other but having the menu infront to be able to point at what I wanted was helpful. It seemed like a very busy place as when I was being served the person serving me had to keep going away to had out orders or answers the phone. The place was clean tidy doesn't look like much foot traction comes through but if there were to be people dine in they would probably want to play somthing other than infomercials. Don't be fooled by the pictures as the look of the pictures definitely does not match the taste of the food. It's not a place I'll be going back to especially if I'm going to be spending over $80 I expect the quality and taste to be some what decent.",

I have arrived to the front of the food truck and requested a delivery order and she went to the bag to pick this order to bring it to me. While another colleague was already serving a customer who was ready to leave, she came back with my order and interrupted them to engage in a personal conversation, even though the customer was already served. This meant that I was left waiting, even though she was not busy with another customer. When I tried to get her attention she's just turned her back to me and pretend that she was doing something in the computer so I insist politely multiple times (five or six times), she continued to ignore me and refused to provide the manager's name or assist further, stating that the manager wouldn't be available until Sunday. This behavior is unacceptable and reflects poorly on customer service standards. No one should be treated this way, and it truly ruined my day.",

No, the 5 stars are for a combination of price\/value efficiency and intangibles. There is something about Thai container that is really appealing. I went there three times in almost as many days and thought about going even more. The food is good. They thought I had an Australian accent, which is hilarious (I am an american) and like all Thai restaurants in the world, as far as I can tell, they seemed worried about me trying anything too spicy.

The food left alot to be desired.. I had lamb shank in what appeared to be a bowl of soup...the lamb shank had no real flavor and the soup very watery.. A friend across from my had the salmon..and albit ,was very well portioned again lacked any flavor at all and was quite disappointed.. The person next to my right had the Duck and seemed to be the only one i spoke to that enjoyed his meal.. Another person at the table had to leave because of a food allergy.. She told them ..( gave them specific instructions which were ignored) .. Which resultsed in a reaction. So all in all.. The evening was pleasant..but not fantastic!",

However, I have had a lot of Thai food all over the United States and nothing has even come close to my experience at Thai Orchid! I normally order either Pad Thai or Geen Curry, but the owner had a few other suggestions. We took his advice. My husband and I split the #9 Goong Tod, # 31 Pad Phed and #41 Ped Thai Orchid. The #31 was so delicious that we decided to go back on Christmas Day! That night I ordered the #31 AGAIN and my husband ordered the Pad Kee Mao (not sure of the number). The food is authentic, fresh and full of flavor!!! I don't think you could go wrong with anything on the menu. Bonus...The service is FABULOUS! The owner is amazing and all of the servers are great!!! I would make a trip to Christchurch next time we are on the South Island just to visit Thai Orchid. I cannot recommend highly enough!!!",

The owner had many suggestions for food, we ended up going with the Fish Cakes, Fried Rice, and Pad Se-Ew. The fish cakes were okay, a little bit on the greasy side but everything else was fantastic! The owner insisted on the fried rice being cooked in a special way using green curry to give it an extra \"kick\" and it was a great suggestion. The pad se-ew noodles were delicious with a generous portion of tender beef slices.

Since then, most of their ratings have been outstanding but they are still averaged in with the poor ratings from the previous owner. We recently spent 14 days in New Zealand and Fiji and found most of the restaurants we ate at to be unremarkable..until we accidentally found the Thai Orchard. Jules greeted us at the door as if he knew us and started tutoring us on selecting a Thai beer. His partner Jum came right to the table to offer her selections on their best dishes. Believe me, she didn't steer us wrong. It was by far, the best meal we hAd in all of New Zealand. The desserts were out of this world. But what made this place so fantastic was the staff, especially the owners. I noticed a previous comment about the decor...like I said, Jum and Jules are new owners and have great plans for the place. In the next few months they are updating the decor, fixing up the outdoor patio and adding the Crazy Horse Bar upstairs. Give the place a chance, I promise you will love it. If you are one of those that tried it under the old owner, give Jum and Jules a chance to win you over.",

I was disappointed though to see that the wine list is limited and not high quality. The decor and the dining room is very dated and could use some updating, but that has no bearing on the food quality. I had the spring rolls, which were fantastic and fried to perfection. The sweet and sour sauce was no slouch either. I had the Pad Thai for dinner and it is a huge portion! I could not finish the whole plate, but Lord knows I tried. The Pad Thai tastes pretty authentic and has good flavor. i was missing a little \"green\" though, and would have like some spring onions or something garnished on top.

For one, we found ourselves looking into a laundry area (possibly the owner's home?) whilst dining.

The grilled meat was tender and smoky, with just the right amount of spice and tang from the lime and chili. Fresh herbs and crunchy veggies balanced it beautifully - every bite was refreshing yet bold in flavor. The menu has plenty of tempting options (curries, noodles, and some great lunch specials), but if you're after something light, vibrant, and packed with authentic Thai flavor, the Nam Tok salad is a must-try. Definitely one of the best Thai spots I've been to in Christchurch!",

We had a really lovely experience, with classic pub food - opting for burgers as there was a Tuesday $20 special on. Recommend asking to sit out on the deck in the restaurant for this coming summer, there was decent cover and the last of the days sun sent the beers down easy. The fry on the fish, chicken and chips for the burgers was actually perfect, and made for a pretty great dinner. Chef could be a smidgen heavier on the seasoning, and would love to see citrus with the fish burger to make this a truly classic pub fish dish. We'll absolutely be back to try some more meals, as they have a lot of amazing Glutenfree choices too.",

Not the first time I've found this decrepit place scrounging for any dollar they can. Might as well drink at the Sandridge, friendlier staff, better quality toilets, and they won't steal your more than well paid for drinks! White blonde females practices should be reviewed.

My suggestion is when you get group bookings esp for Families put them in that space infront of the Dart Board because we didn't have to talk over each other and it's a perfect spot near the Big Screen where you can still enjoy a meal, drink and watch the sports. We set up the tables there. Service is friendly but waited awhile ordering the platter for 2 off the smokehouse menu. The Waffle Fries and Sausage is what I enjoyed. Everyone's Burgers looked amazing I think they enjoyed them? You have to go to the bar and order your food. They don't have a person coming to your table to take orders.

We were told no jugs for 30 minutes in a very rude and unwelcoming way, we waited 30 minutes and returned to be told no jugs at all, then asked if there are cocktails and were told \"no cocktails while we are busy\" which was silly because there was two people waiting to order a drink, and the bar itself didn't even have all its seats filled. Honestly, just a rude experience when there was absolutely no need for the treatment we received. Where is the customer service?? As someone who has worked years in hospitality this was so unnecessary, people politely coming to order and being told \"no\" to every request without even a kind \"no sorry we aren't serving that anymore.\" This is clearly a show of ageism, if not plain rudeness, with uni students being treated poorly for no reason whatsoever.",

Poached eggs with hollandaise sauce on a crispy potato pave - this was very heavy and can be avoided if you don't want to take a nap! 5.

Like some other reviews mention, they could have a combo option for solo travellers. The place is bit cramped, I was bit early so didn't have problem finding a seat. Definitely recommend for those Thai food lovers.",

We had 2 cocktails to shared. I had a basil chilli crispy pork with rice while my husband had a tofu veggie peanut sauce stir-fry with rice. The food was delicious but massive we were so full before we could get through the whole plate so had to skip the dessert! The lady who look after the door and casher was super friendly and calm with the crazy paces of people come and go and needed to go to the threter! The restaurant is in a beautiful colourful stripe",

As someone who's sampled Thai cuisine extensively, I can confidently say this was not only the best Thai food I've ever had but also ranks among the most exceptional meals of my life. The dishes were a symphony of flavors, expertly crafted and bursting with freshness. Beyond the incredible food, the staff's warmth and attentiveness truly stood out. Their genuine smiles and dedication to customer satisfaction created a welcoming and delightful atmosphere. Fawn (the owner) was incredibly sweet and a lovely person overall! Without hesitation, I will be returning to The Nook Thai Eatery and enthusiastically recommending it to anyone visiting Christchurch. Do yourself a favor and prepare for a truly unforgettable meal.",

Just imagine, they had the audacity to serve the same rice that had ants crawling. Taking them out does not mean they did not left their dirt on the rice. Not apologetic at all.

The breakfast bap we got was nice but for $15 should have at least came with abit more bacon and a wee side salad. It looked very sad all on its own on a huge plate.

These guys judge you the second you step in line. If you ask why you're being denied entry, they can't even give you a straight answer. All you get is some nonsense excuse about \"the camera\" or whatever. One night they'll let you in, the next night they'll tell you you're not allowed - with zero explanation. And what's with the so-called dress code? Do they expect everyone to dress exactly the same? What's the difference between a shirt with a design and a plain one? It feels like they just assume anyone with a bit of style is in a gang or there to cause trouble. That's pure discrimination, and it's pathetic. Keep treating people like that, and karma's going to come right back around - especially when you end up letting the wrong person in because they \"look right\" to you. THIS IS BS.",

I was so lucky to get to enjoy Mango Sticky Rice with fresh mango, especially since it's only available for a limited time!

The restaurant advertises itself as an all-you-can-eat experience, but it felt like a SCAM. The price had recently changed without any notice, and it wasn't mentioned when we arrived. We were seated from 5:30 pm to about 7:10 pm and only received about one and a half rounds of food. When we asked for more, the service was painfully slow. There were only four staff members: two chefs cooking, one chef running around, and one lady handling drinks and seating. With just five tables occupied, there's no reason the service should have been that poor. On top of that, the portions were smaller compared to Tony's in Riccarton, and the whole experience was frustrating. If you claim to be all-you-can-eat, you should actually deliver that not make customers wait ages for minimal food. Overall, this felt misleading and disappointing. I would not recommend the Ferrymead location at all.",

Other tables not cleared after guests left. Had the \"all you could eat\" and were told we could only have 1 extra dish each, waited for 30 mins and still didn't receive it.

Intimate space in a lovely location with great service, expansive wine selection and they are happy to make you a tasty mocktail that suits your palate. Now... the food. Epic. Seasonal. Simple. Divine. I started with their marinated tomato salad which was fresh and flavorful. Entree was the steak with potato, onion rings and veggies - absolutely incredible. Naturally I had to save room for dessert and landed on the vanilla cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e (though all the options sounded amazing).

During our visit to Christchurch we found several interesting places to eat and wanted to make our last night special by choosing this locally well rated restaurant. As the name suggests, you enter by climbing 27 steps to find a very small space with minimalist furnishings of very simple tables and chairs. A small complete bar is to your right as you enter - we were quickly seated at a postage stamp sized table. The menu is basically what the chef fancies to prepare for dinner - so on-line menus just list items that are basic rather than recommended for each evening. I enjoy one of the best prepared filet Mignons I have eaten in a long time and shared some of my wife's risotto and a house made bread to make a wonderful tasting meal! Although they were very busy, our server took her time with us to ensure we got the best of what they had to offer - including a very tasty Pinot Noir fro the region.

We hadn't finished our drinks and felt like we were just being pushed out the door. We had a reservation by the way, 6pm, Sunday night. Hardly a peak busy night where they are trying to turn people through quickly. Otherwise service was prompt and \"polite\" enough. But not warm or inviting.

You definitely need a reservation, especially if you're coming in after 6pm. They start you off with a thick piece of herby bread and butter and a jug of lemon water. To drink I tried a glass of the \"skin ferment\" wine, which I'd never heard of, but the servers insisted it was worth a try. It has a reddish orangey color, kind of like rum punch. And it tastes a bit like fruit juice or cider. It wasn't bad! I don't know that I would order it again with dinner, but it could be a fun drink-outside-with-your-friends wine, like ros\u00e9's cousin. For dinner I went with the herb crusted salmon over a bed of roasted potatoes, tomatoes, and capers. It was pretty good, but I wasn't able to finish it. The salmon portion was huge and it was just drenched in herbs; too much for my taste. The potatoes and tomatoes were on point though! Service is friendly, but slow.

I'm not a big lamb fan but when my fianc\u00e9 got it, I had to try. It was cooked well, melt in your mouth, and not overly lamby. I know that sounds weird but I find lamb has a very strong, pungent taste. Definitely a must when on new regent street and Christchurch CBD in general. Just don't count the steps and you won't be disappointed.",

        "text":"Wow! So many good things to say about this place. Definitely make a reservation as it is a cozy place with limited seating. To begin, the decor is adorable and welcoming; the staff is super friendly and attentive; and the seating is comfortable and cozy. I sat alone, but had great conversation with the different staff. One of my servers discussed my wine tastes before letting me try two before settling on a glass. Both of her picks were spot on AND she let me know that a bottle was open that was not normally open so I could try a glass of that, as well. Really great service there. Let's start with the bread- homemade heaven with butter. Crumbles in your mouth. I don't normally eat bread- this bread is bomb. I was having trouble deciding on the menu since everything that was delivered near me looked and smelled amazing. I settled on the roasted red capsicum tomato and red onion soup with got cheese, terragon and lemon creme fraiche. While not a fan of goat cheese (AT ALL) this was a delight hunt of flavor in a wonderful soup. It's light and creamy but still satisfying and bursting with flavor. They also let me get a *teacup* size since I didn't want to ruin my appetite on the starter. For the main, I chose the Pan fried salmon with capers, garlic crush potatoes, summer veg, and a banana prawns + lobster Marie Rose sauce topped with a cucumber salsa. The salmon fell apart on my plate. Even the roasted tomatoes on the side were amazing. I've had salmon 4 times while traveling NZ- this one takes the cake by far. This meal was fabulous and a great way to close out my New Zealand adventure.",

Oh and some tasty guest beers or several tantalising gins from across NZ! We loved it so much that we held our wedding reception here!

Worth the 30-Minute Wait Christchurch finally has real Hong Kong-style claypot rice - and yes,FIRST ONE TO ORDER AT 12:00pm, OTHER CUSTOMER CAME AROUND 12:20PM still I waited 30 minutes, but it was totally worth it. This new spot is still finding its rhythm, so expect a bit of a wait\u2026 but once that sizzling pot hits the table, you'll forget all about the delay. I ordered the Lup Cheong Claypot Rice - topped with smoky Chinese sausage and crispy-bottomed rice, just like it's supposed to be. Pour the soy sauce over and mix it up - the aroma alone is enough to bring tears to your eyes On the side: THESE CAME REALLY QUICKLY Garlic Pork Belly (\u849c\u6ce5\u767d\u8089) - thinly sliced pork belly drenched in garlic-chili sauce. Cold, bold, and the perfect contrast to the hot claypot. Daily Soup - loaded with carrots, mushrooms, bamboo, and pork. Comfort in a bowl. Heads up: It's made fresh to order, so be patient (we waited 30+ minutes). But honestly? Zero regrets. Price: Around $15-20 per dish Tip: Dine in if you can - the claypot crust doesn't travel well! Update: They've got BBQ now Tried the chicken wings today - crispy on the outside, tender and juicy inside The aroma hits you hard, and the flavor just keeps pulling you in! Best part? It's super affordable! Pair it with a cold beer and you've got the perfect combo",

The food truck does a great range of pub type food and is reasonably priced. It has a very relaxed atmosphere. There are large tables and plenty of comfy sofas and chairs to relax in. Definitely recommend for that craft brew you might be looking for.",

I went with my two kids, and they gave me a piece of paper that looked like a coloring book. I didn't realize there was a kids' menu on it. I thought they were just giving it to the kids to keep them entertained before they got their food. When we ordered, we ordered pizza and fries, and the fries were $10. There were $5 and $10 sizes on the kids' menu, but they should have at least told us when we ordered. It wasn't that busy, after all. When we were paying, I saw a sign on the wall that said the kids' menu was free on Wednesdays. What was that? Why didn't they tell us?",

        "text":"I had been wanting to order from here for ages after hearing good things about this place from Friends. Finally had the opportunity tonight and my review is a little mixed. After reading the other reviews I knew that there would likely be a long waiting time for the food. They opened at 4:30pm, and we called through to order at around 5:10pm. They quoted a wait time of 1 hour and 15 minutes. We were happy with this as we had called in early. The wait time ended up being pretty accurate - which was good service. When my partner came to collect around 6:30ish another person came into order and left pretty quickly after being quoted a 2 hour wait time for food. This seems like a major issue for this place - they can't handle many orders as there is only one guy cooking the food. We ordered mild chicken green curry and chicken Pad Thai. The portion size of the Pad Thai was great and the Pad Thai was good. For $15 this was great value for money but taste wise was not anything amazing. Unfortunately the big let down for me was the green curry which was what I was most looking forward to \/ craving the most. Green curry is my usual dish at places at little high, thai orchard etc. On the phone the lady asked if we wanted the curry mild, medium or hot. We said mild and she repeated back to us that it was mild we were ordering. My Partner can handle a bit a spice, but I can't so I always like to get mild to get a mild spice flavour or no spice at all. THE CURRY TASTED LIKE SPICY WATER. I'm certain I was probably given a hot curry by mistake because it was so hot I couldn't eat any of it. My partner also said it was very hot and he couldn't have a lot of it due to the bland flavour \/ texture. I can acknowledge when a dish is spicy and flavourful - however all you could taste was spicy water. It was horrible and went straight into the bin which is a real shame. No nice curry texture, coconut or anything. I wouldn't recommend the curry even if you could handle the spice. No flavour, bland and tasted awful - the spice didn't even match the flavour profile of a typical spicy green curry. Due to the fuss with the waiting time, probably won't come back here again as it's not really worth it. Very disappointing :(",

We were told 40 mins. We waited some more. With a 40 minute wait you'd expect to walk in and have mutlple chefs gone but no. There was one. I walked in the store and got the food. After a brief and frisk drive home, the smell of this takeaway wofting into my nostrils had me readily for a goon. I then got home. One sip of the Panang curry, One bite of curry puff, one tear of spare rib. I knew I'd hit a gem! Ken oath legends This Thai place is a keeper!",

Great vibe on a Saturday night, hard to find a Bar on the Terrace that has a R&B + Hip Hop DJ and it wasn't overly crowded made the experience even better tbh. Bar Staff were friendly, drinks like wow budget friendly as we know places on the Terrace can charge your soul for drinks Definitely recommend for all looking for this kind of vibe Did the Cocktail Lunch Club as a Pre Mothers Day and wow absolutely amazing experience. It's a 2 course lunch and they bring everything out to share that's on the menu and 5 cocktails per person. Great value for money. Cocktails were to my liking, staff were friendly and atmosphere of the place was my vibe. Would definitely recommend to all to try this. Food was yummy!",

Best meal of the two week trip through Auckland, Queenstown, Rotorua, and Wellington. We've been to several of the \"Best Of...\" restaurants on this trip and there was only one other place (Charley Noble in Wellington) that was even close to as good as 5th street. We sat at the Chefs Table which made everything even better because Samson served us and he's one of the co-owners and lead chefs crafting the menu. Such a great dude, and his team is really doin the Lord's work over here. We had four cocktails (Mezcal Milkpunch, Spritz 2x, and the Stirred). The lead bartender is a blast as well and is coming up with some truly delicious, refreshing drinks on this ever-changing menu (so I hear). We got the broccolini, the beef with pickled ginger, potatoes, and the true gem of the meal = the lamb shoulder. The lamb melts in your mouth. Do not hesitate for a second to order it even if you're not a big red meat eater! I'm sitting here at the airport not an hour removed from dinner and I had to write this review because of the lamb AND the quality of service. Props to Samson, Chris, and the third mustached musketeer \/ co-owner for creating such a memorable dining experience. And if you're wondering, \"is this guy still buzzed from the drinks he ordered at dinner?\" The answer is \"Hell yes. I couldn't NOT order a 4th cocktail.\" Anyway, cheers to the 5th street team for the beautiful work you're doing. We'll think of you every time we talk about our trip to NZ and\/or use the chili oil we bought on our way out.",

It's literally filled with plants and green decorations. Beautiful lighting. Hipster vibe. Service No issues here. We sat at the 'chef's table' which is really 4 bar seats in front of the kitchen. This made the experience for us! The sous chef spoke with us and answered questions all while doing his job of cooking. He also let us try the zucchini fritters on the house. Outstanding gesture!

All dining guests are seated facing around the master chef, we found it enjoyable and had an intimate conversation while eating even with company of strangers, we both decided to order the Amaterrace special which is NZ 49$ that included an appetizer, soup, 5 hibachi entrees and dessert. We started off with cold bottle of sake, miso soup and has started making stir fried mix veggies, he then followed it with tiger prawns glazed with butter, Akaroa salmon with scallops, teppanyaki fried rice together with NZ premium eye fillet served with garlic mushrooms and marinated grilled chicken, we found it overwhelming but managed to finish all the dishes as they were cooked and served right before our very eyes. We then capped our dinner with a delicious ice cream with chocolate syrup. I considered our dining experience here as one of our best dinners while vacationing in New Zealand, The customer service was awesome, dishes were served in timely fashion in this pristine restaurant with a view. This place is a must try when in Christchurch city Centre!",

        "text":"Excellent little cafe nestled right on the Avon River across the street from the hospital. This cafe became a little escape for me as my mom required unexpected surgery while we were visiting from the States. It was always very busy but I always somehow managed to grab a table on the patio. Most of the outdoor seating is covered but there were a few that weren't. I happily took one in the sun as I was growing tired of the hospital ward staleness. You order at the counter, get a number and have a seat. They have a large selection of pastries and pre made sandwiches as well as a large sit down menu. Soups, salads, sandwiches, fish. All kinds of good stuff. I didn't eat breakfast there but they have pancakes, eggs, etc. Food and drinks are brought out to you. Service was always friendly and very prompt. I was regularly surprised at how quickly my food came out despite how busy it was. Lamb burger was delicious. Freshest feta I've ever had and the beet compote type thing on it was delish. I could have eaten that alone as a side dish. My one gripe was that it also had mayo and tomato on it which wasn't stated on the menu. I hate when places don't list all the ingredients they plan to put on my sandwich. I HATE mayo so that was a bummer. Luckily it was mostly on the lettuce so I was able to get it mostly off :) Another day I had the fish and chips. It was very clear that fish was probably swimming this morning. Yum yum yum fresh! My favorite by far was the chicken, pesto and Brie sandwich. Chicken was grilled perfectly and that pesto, oh that pesto! It puts other pestos to shame. Easily the best and most fresh pesto I've ever had. Swoon indeed. The coffees are great. Iced Americano and flat white both lovely. Wonderful place with wonderful staff and excellent food.",

The restaurant is inside an upscale, hipster food court with a number of other eclectic places. The entire place was clean, bright and welcoming. We had a bacon cheeseburger, vegan burger and and an order of fries. The burgers were hot and tasty. The fries were a huge portion and well seasoned. My only criticism is that they were a bit soggy. They appeared double fried, but should have been left in a bit longer. The guy and girl at the counter were both friendly and professional. Definitely worth it. Highly recommend.",

Either way, a trendy and fun place, pretty reasonably priced, only downside is they got my mom's order wrong, but that can be easily remedied. I got the Ben from accounting and it had pineapple and the bacon was delicious and I love love LOVE the bun. Also really fun that they put your fries\/onion rings on cutting boards. Also, in love with the Aoli\/bbq sauce combo they give you. 10\/10 would recommend!! Come to America if you haven't already bacon brothers!!",

Once inside you'll find a host of other delicious eateries, much like a hipster gourmet food court. I ordered the Big Jim and it included fried chicken, bacon, avocado, and a yummy aioli (a NZ favorite which is a more delicious version of American ranch dressing). I had to remove the fried chicken because I couldn't bite into the burger due to its size, but it was fantastic! I got the fried cauliflower as a side and it was absolutely delectable. They were drizzled with maple syrup which was a salty\/sweet combination that made my taste buds flutter with excitement. The guy at the counter was super cool, and gave my husband a discount for having a rad beard. Also, something I thought was extra special was that anything on the menu can be made vegan! Keep in mind that seating is a fight for your life ordeal, so be aggressive and send your friends to find a spot while you're in line to order, otherwise you'll be walking around forever trying to find a spot to sit. Still worth all the trouble, though. All in all, one of the best meals we had in New Zealand, and the best food in Christchurch.",

The whole eatery is more like OFF an alley off High Street and is easily obscured by some taller buildings. Doesn't matter, FIND IT, it's worth it. 'The Little High Eatery' has about a dozen really cool, bohemian, artesian places. Always better to support local than chains, go get out of Bubba Gump or the Olive Garden, and go to Bacon Bros. Seriously kickin' burger, cooked perfectly, all the ingredients were fresh, the brioche bun soft but slightly chewy at the same time, and some nice slab bacon on top. Very reasonably priced.

Oh my, this was way too good. The crust was thin and crispy, just the way I love it. The thin lamb slices were marinated an cooked well.

We are a family of four with the oldies keen on jazz and blues, so a winner withe the set up and piped music. It feels like a place that goes off later in the evening, but cannot comment on that yet. The staff are friendly, efficient and not intrusive, just right for our needs. The drinks menu is extensive with us two oldies just having beers, but our son had a Roger Rabbit? cocktail which he really enjoyed with his sweet tooth. But the range is extensive and only limited by your imagination and liver. The food is based on southern USA and can be summed up as delicious sticky goodness. We shared some pretzel bread with a chilli molasses butter, which sounds interesting, but tastes divine and some Cajun fries which cater for the more timid Kiwi palate. Missy had chicken sliders which literally disappeared within minutes as we shared some Bourbon and coke ribs, gooey and tasty. We also tried the chicken tenders with a maple and black pepper sauce as well as the sirloin with loaded tater tots, both of which were delicious. We have big appetites and we were unable to consider pudding. Great place, great food and I want to go back without the kids for a later night.",

It was an open mic night and the music was super enjoyable but we sat on the edge of the bar where there are several pointless wax candles burning. Midway through the night, a wax edge broke and it began pouring down on us, scalding hot to skin and staining to clothes! I ran to the bar to ask for help extinguishing the high candles and was actually laughed at by the bar tender. We were dealing with scalding wax burning us and the staff did nothing but laugh. It instantly went from having a wonderful night, to one of the worst nights out we'd ever experienced. I work in the industry, which makes dealing with such lack of common decency from others within the same industry even more deplorable. As an establishment, the candles should be removed for health and safety standards, as a staff, the male bar tender on Wednesday January 24th, 2018 should either be fired or taught how to treat other human beings with at least some sense of decency before being allowed to work in the customer service industry.",

We didn't learn until we sat down and read the menu that the prices were only lower because this was a 'tapas' style restaurant. Whoops. So we ended up spending a lot of money on a little bit of food. But since the food was good I left it a good rating. The drinks looked amazing but we were hungry and tired and not in the mood to add a hangover to our morning. Apparently it is all about their alcoholic milkshakes but the sugar would have kept me up all night and it was a freezing cold night and we didn't have a car and the hotel was a far walk from town. We ended up sharing the deviled eggs app, the Venison balls, and the sliders. We ordered 2 beef sliders and one chicken slider and both were good. The beef was better so just order 3 of those. Afterwards we weren't full but also weren't still hungry. Probably would go to the other restaurants next time.",

But what would one expect from a bacon cheeseburger that adds pineapple, avocado and beetroot to its content? Aside from the cheese, every topping and condiment on that sandwich is slippery. The combination isn't one I'd experienced before, but I found it all well matched. And I was surprised to find all that content didn't overwhelm the flavor of the beef (though not by much). I might give even greater props, though, to the fries. Remember the perfect crispness of McDonald's fries when they were at their best? Take that fry quality but apply it to a chunkier, thicker cut of potato, and that's what you'll get at BurgerFuel. Delicious. I enjoyed this meal after some lengthy travels, and the restaurant is positioned well for air and road travelers, being just off State Highway 1 and only a short distance from CHC. Getting back to the sloppiness, it was only in the finishing bites of my meal that I realized the staff had provided me with a tool to help keep my burger together -- the nifty little Doofer, a pop-together burger keeper that my ignorance kept me from testing when I needed it most. Guess I'll have to stop in again and see how well it actually works.",

The burgers are a little but pricey which I believe may turn a few customers away - especially international travellers.

Has a rustic-chic sort of vibe, but it in a bloke-y kind of way, if that makes any sense at all. The Brewery (Cassels & Sons) is part of The Tannery shopping complex. They've got a narrow indoor seating area next to the bar and wood-fired pizza oven, and also a spacious outdoor area with plastic sidings and roof in wet or windy weather. Every time I've been here, I've sat in the outdoor area, which is nice even though your view is basically of the parking lot. This place can get pretty busy, so just be aware at peak times that you might have a bit of a wait before you can find a seat. Father's Day breakfast was a 45-minute wait (somewhat understandable) but even on regular weekends this place can get busy. The food is uninspired. They really have nothing on the menu for vegans, except hummus and flatbread. For breakfast, all I could order was the toast with jam and cream sans the cream. The staff was rather unapologetic about this as well. Guess they don't get many vegans in here. My parents also felt the food was a bit so-so. Also, they'd run out of the dish that my dad wanted, so he had to choose something else. (Father's Day problems again, I guess.) Overall, I'd say -- make this a drinking spot, not an eating spot.",

I had to settle for an apple cider when I last visited; while admittedly very tasty, I was keen to try the grape and berry cider (sadly sold out). They've got a whole heap of seating, indoors and outdoors, making it suitable for group gatherings. Often there is a band playing in the afternoon.

I'm giving this restaurants 5 stars not only for the quality of the food for its pricepoint, but also for the effort put in by the management for opening on Christmas Day (which I think is really a truly needed public service). We ordered the pad thai with prawns, as well as a fried rice with chicken. The pad thai tasted authentic with very fresh (and plentiful!) prawns; not spicy, but I was able to add siracha to my liking. The fried rice was good, with some vegetables thrown in as well. I personally liked the pad thai more, of the two. The service was also very attentive. Really appreciate the staff opening shop on Christmas Day! Finally, the price was on point - the best value for our NZD on this trip so far. The three of us only spent 30NZD on our meal.",

So I recommend making a booking if you plan on dining here. I ordered the roasted cauliflower, that came with a romesco sauce, a fish taco, and one of their sangrias. Everything was delicious! I love roasted cauliflower and theirs definitely ticks all the boxes. It was perfectly charred on the outside and soft on the inside. The romesco sauce was bright flavors from the acidity of the tomato, which paired well with the smokiness of the cauliflower. The fish taco was good too! It wasn't greasy despite it being fried. It came with capers, which I don't actually like, but in this taco it was yummy and needed with the fish. The sangria was comprised of ros\u00e9, mint, and strawberries. It was light and fruity. Service was excellent! The staff made sure I was doing fine throughout my meal. The atmosphere is vibrant and loud. Chiwahwah's seems to be more of a fusion restaurant, but I don't think they advertised themselves as a traditional Mexican restaurant anyway.

The establishment is on the louder side when it comes to voices from nearby tables and the music playing through their sound system. Their only saving grace was the food. It was great. It was definitely not Mexican though. I would categorize it more as a fusion between New Zealand and Mexican, so Kiwi-Mexican.

Originally gave it a 2 but the owners like to let their business down by trying snarky responses to reviews that they don't like instead of taking constructive criticism on board and fixing their own faults. When we arrived we were greeted and sat and all was very friendly. First thing we notice is everyone in the restaurant is just yelling so loudly that we couldn't even speak between ourselves. Way too loud and I don't know why. It was like this all night and my ears are still ringing the day after. For this I won't be returning. The next thing is we sat for nearly 20mins eating for someone to come and take out order, even just for drinks. We were getting pretty pissed off by this point and was on the verge of leaving because we couldn't talk with it being so loud. After a further nearly 20mins the food came and it was ok. The monkey bread was nice but was pricey just for a mini pizza.... The quesadilla was good. The fried chicken was not. I've never had anything so oily in my life. I ordered the fried chicken sliders and it was just tasteless from the amount of oil onboard the chicken. No care from the chef. Just a basic thing to do...they need some basic chef training to learn how to not make the chicken drip with oil. All in all waaaay too loud, too expensive and not that great...the artwork was cool though..you definitely get enough time to look at it because you can't talk because everyone was yelling. We weren't the only ones that were complaining about the 2 large tables yelling and filling the entire restaurant with noise. Several others had the same feelings. Never returning, not recommended.

It's not quite like a rolled pita pocket (say from pita pit), but a Greek version of, with a much thicker bread rolled into a cone shape to hold the ingredients. Suggest getting the standard sauces, which include a garlic yoghurt tatziki and a Greek tomato based sauce. Together with a juicy meat of your choice (chicken, lamb, beef, or mixed) and salad it's a very tasty lunch indeed. A single is $10, double $12.50, and triple $15.50.

I also wished the sauce for the red wine\/pulled beef didn't spread out all over the rest of the dumplings, because they had their own flavors that didn't need to be overshadowed.

Service is really nice, with friendly staff and informal but respectful practices. We enjoyed lovely Scallops, Lamb rolls and Soup for entrees, then Eye Fillet steak, Salmon Fillet and Fish of the Day (Terakihi) for mains. Our sides were Mesclun Salad and Duck Fat Potatoes. Everything was really good, nicely presented, with good quality produce and good size portions. The wine list is very nice. Dessert was Chocolate Brownie and Ginger Pudding. There is no surprise about its popularity, everything was great. We were probably last to leave but didn't feel rushed at all, which was appreciated. The location is great, right across the road from the Arts Centre and on the tram route, within short walking distance of the river and city CBD. Parking on the nearby streets was available too. It's very good, I would recommend it.",

It was cool and blustery, and we wanted something warming. Wow! Did this place deliver! Super friendly staff welcomed us. As it was Sunday, many were there for brunch. I saw many plates with eggs and other goodies that looked great. But we were here for lunch. My husband had a pie stuffed with smoked pork that he said was delicious. It came with a pea pur\u00e9e and lovely salad. I chose the pappardelle with lamb ragout and white bean pur\u00e9e. The shredded lamb was a delight and the sauce was light and flavorful with a hint of Moroccan spice, but light. The top of the food had some shavings of cheese and what appeared to be radish sprouts. It was lush and unctuous with a marvelous taste and texture. Perfect comfort food for such cool, damp late summer day. The bean pur\u00e9e was a simple foil with hint of the spice I mentioned, or was that the only place where it was? I'm not sure, but it was yummy. We had a nice bottle of central Otago Pinot noir which was nicely acidic that was nice food wine and matched our meals perfectly. The meal with the wine, which was over 50% of the bill, came to US $75. Very fine meal and worth every penny.",

So, imagine my surprise when it came in an egg patty! I have to admit I was a bit disappointed. It was okay, but you really couldn't taste the fish - mostly egg. I pried a fish to taste by itself, but the egg was too overpowering. I think since this is a seasonal fish, the fish should be showcased. Without the citrus mayo, this would've been a bland dish I learned from the waitress that this fish is always served in the form of a patty with something else. Too bad New Zealanders don't make a snack like Malaysians do, with dried small fish, peanuts, and sambal. That would be great!",

Dining solo presented a challenge as I could only sample one meal. Judging off of previous Yelp comments and my desire to try local, I went with the Canterbury Lamb Shoulder. Having nothing else on the menu to compare it to, I certainly vouch for this dish. You won't be disappointed. Served on a bit of greens and topped with a fruit sauce, the lamb, which had obviously been stewing for awhile, was super tender and extremely flavorful. In addition to its succulence, the portion was quite substantial! Adding a side of baby spinach salad and a Black Dog draft beer ensured I had no room for dessert. Peeking at the table next to me, another customer had ordered the salmon. Based on appearance and the clean plate after 15 minutes, I'd guess that dish also comes recommended. One last thing, the service was excellent - welcoming, warm, and prompt!",

Next we ordered the feast, and it included a salad, lamb, roasted onions, peas, stuffed mushrooms, and two sides that included duck fat potatoes, and another salad. The lamb was cold and flavorless. It seemed like the chef had no idea how to cook lamb. Both salads were boring and also flavorless, but the most memorable dish was the potatoes. The duck fat potatoes were the hardest, most dry dish of potatoes I have ever seen in my life. The were impossible to chew because they were rock solid. How on earth do you mess up potatoes?? They're the world's easiest food to cook. Additionally, the portions were tiny for the supposed \"feast\" title. We both left so hungry, and had to order pizza later that evening to make up for it. I want to point out that before we got our food, the couple sitting next to us complained about their meal, so it wasn't just a matter of our taste buds. I will say that the waiter was very nice and the service was good, but I went for the food and the high ratings I saw on Google. It was also $95, including a drink each, and did not include dessert.

We arrived fairly early, around 5:30PM on a Sunday, and the dining room was nearly empty, but did start to fill within an hour or so. The wine list featured a lot of reasonably priced New Zealand selections; we were very happy with our Rockface Pinot Noir. We shared an order of pumpkin hummus as a starter, which was good, and the perfect amount for the three of us to have just a little nibble before entrees. I had the lamb shoulder which was excellent! It was very tender and flavorful, and the potatoes, kale, and sauces all went with it perfectly. A family member also had the lamb, and, unfortunately, one of his two pieces of lamb had a large chunk of fat, but he did enjoy it despite that! Another family member had the fish special, and she said it was delicious! It came with fried whitebait as a topping. Given that this was our first night in New Zealand, we really didn't know what whitebait was....for others who are equally ignorant, it is exactly what it sounds like...tiny bait fish! These were fried up nice and crispy, and we all tried some...just don't think about it too much, or look too closely at them, and they are quite tasty! Dessert was good, but not quite what we expected; all the desserts are served in a deconstructed style which, honestly, isn't a favorite of mine. Service was excellent. Our server was friendly, and knew the menu well. We were seated in a porch-like area that was delightful - bright with lots of greenery! This is a great option for dinner in Christchurch!",

        "text":"After a long journey to make it to New Zealand from the U.S., my wife and I came here for a relatively low-key dinner our first night in the country. We showed up pretty late - around 8:45 in the evening on a Sunday - and while the restaurant still had several tables when we came in, it was virtually deserted by the time we had finished. The restaurant has a modern feel to it, and while it is also a bar, the noise from the television didn't really intrude on the dining space at all. The service was solid at best, with it taking a bit long to place our order at the start and to get the check at the end. While there are some local beers available for order, the one I had (Pointer's Pale Ale) was one of the weakest offerings I've had in that genre of beer. My wife was less than impressed that flavored iced teas were the only option available in that kind of drink. As for the food, I would say that the the bread was arguably the best part of the meal. It tasted like it was all cooked in-house and was warm and fresh. The wheat bread in particular had warmth and fluffiness to it that you would not take from how it was presented (as sliced triangles, like it would be for a sandwich). The butter was also very rich and worked very well with bread as soft as what was served. For an appetizer, we split the seared scallops. While the salsa verde worked very well as a complement to the scallops (which were prepared pretty well), the pickled fennel was a bit of a dissonant note and added too much acidity to the salsa. The entrees were also a bit on the inconsistent side. My wife's lamb shoulder fell apart quite easily, and it had very good smoky flavor - especially paired with the dahl - but paradoxically, the meat itself was also too dry - very little succulence with any bite. After my first choice was dk'ed (the king salmon), I went with the pork belly noodle soup. The pork belly was very juicy and flavorful, and the glass noodles were also pretty solid as well. However, the broth had a very muddled flavor, really making the soup more of a conveyance vehicle for the rest of the dish, as opposed to adding anything to the dish. Overall, Fiddlesticks is a nice spot to take in a meal, but I was not blown away by it. The lamb was surprisingly overcooked, and while some of the fusion elements of the dishes were good (e.g. the dahl), others missed the mark. As a tourist from the other side of the world, I would probably check out another restaurant in Christchurch next time I am in town first.",

The food presentation is stellar, a real feast for the eyes. Most of the food lived up to its looks with the exception of the whitebait patty which the eater felt was a little sparse on the whitebait, heavy on the egg. The fried chicken entree was raved about. My beef fillet was good although I asked for rare and everyone agreed it looked more med-rare. The highlight of it was the proscuitto fries which were very morish, and make up for the fact that Quality of all the meats was top notch though. The fresh fish was absolutely divine, and the venison feast received two thumbs up (well four technically since its a shared dish!). The chocolate truffle dessert was outstanding, a real highlight of the meal for me. The salted caramel dessert was less spectacular but still good. I thought service was above average - friendly, attentive, good humoured. The only small letdown was we were not asked if we wanted another round of drinks which we probably would have gone for if we had been asked, but weren't worried about enough to attract the attention ourselves. He also went to a lot of effort to bill us separately for our individual meals as we requested, even though this is a lot more work for him. There is a lot of seating options in this restaurant including some nice outdoorsy areas which are perfect for summer evenings. I liked the decor, it was fresh and green and welcoming. They had a TV playing old black and white movies on silent which I though was an interesting touch and point of difference!

In that case fine, you can pick up your knife and fork and enjoy it as an open faced sandwich but that was very difficult as it is served on a wooden board (for aesthetic purposes) that was entirely too small so lunch turned out to be a messy experience which is never fun.

I had an expertly cooked steak with mustard and pickled vegetables and some specially prepared \"fries\" and a side of broccoli, the later unfortunately was a little over cooked for me; a very enjoyable meal",

        "text":"It's an interesting name for a restaurant since 'Fisherman's Wharf' brings ideas of a water-place community where fisherman come in from the sea with the freshest products from the sea. There might be a variety of seafood restaurants at a fisherman's wharf, but the singularity of naming a restaurant that, confused me for a bit. But I realized it was a single restaurant, located between the cruise port of Lyttelton and its town center. It did have a variety of seafood, and much of it was excellent. We didn't have a reservation, but were seated right away. There are choices of both outdoor and indoor dining, and the back outdoor patio was available (though it filled up by the time we left). It had a great view of the port, with the ship that we came in on, prominently visible on the skyline. A bottle of tap water was provided so we could fill our own glass...the water is very good here. Dozen Bluff oysters: 6 of them raw, 6 battered and fried. NZ$72 We came for the Bluff oysters, which are currently in season. It was the first time I had them, and they were superb, unlike other oysters I've had. They are decent in size, but the difference is the texture, meaty instead of slippery. It's not as briny as other oysters, and didn't come with any vinegar but instead a shareable green salad. They are big enough to deep fry, which were fine. But the best way is to eat them raw, to appreciate the taste and texture. Fresh NZ Green lipped mussels. NZ$25.5 - probably 8 large full shell mussels, swimming in a light creamy tomato broth. Frozen NZ half shelf mussels are available around the world, being very meaty. These tasted similar, but were quite a bit larger in size which added to enjoyment. This dish would be excellent served on top of fresh pasta. Seafood Sizzle Plate (NZ$46.5) - portrayed as their most popular dish, it combines a variety of popular shellfish, served on a sizzling plate. All the seafood was good. Fisherman's Seafood Chowder (NZ$30.5) - a volute (basic french white sauce, no cream but uses butter) based soup, full of quality seafood. This was the dish I thought I wouldn't be able to help finish, but ended up being the one where I ate the most of. It came with a very good garlic bread, great to dip in the soup. Blue Cod Fish Fry (NZ$40) - a large beer battered filet of cod, served with good chips (fries). They had four beers on tap, so got a pint (NZ$14) of Montheiths Golden Lager, which was a good beer to drink with the seafood. Service was prompt and friendly throughout, and the food didn't take very long to come out. Of course, the beautiful weather and nice seaside views certainly didn't hurt the vibe. It was a really nice lunch.",

We had great service both from the wait staff and at the bar when we needed to order drinks. I ordered the Chicken stonegrill which had a sort of teriyaki marinade on it with a garden salad and mashed potatoes. The chicken was also served with three different dipping sauces including a sweet and sour, ranch and chipotle mayo. I preferred the chipotle mayo. The chicken cooks very quickly and is easy to overdo, so be sure to monitor it closely. My husband ordered the Canterbury Fillet stonegrill which he cooked to about medium rare before pulling them off the grill. This also cooks very quickly! His sides were the seasonal veges and kumara mash. We both finished our entire plates. This location does trivia on thursdays, also in the oval room, and absolutely requires a booking at least a few days in advance (if not more). This is different from most trivia venues because it is in an intimate setting with only so many spaces for players. There is also a second story seating level at this bar and patio seating outdoors (with heat lamps). Overall, great spot, great experience!",

With the menu offerings focused on pizzas and pastas, we both chose to start with a pear-and-gorgonzola salad, with toasted focaccia for the table. The salad greens were perfectly dressed, and the pears had just the right amount of crunch. I would have preferred a bit more gorgonzola, but I'm quite a cheese lover. The duck ragu risotto was fantastic. The risotto was cooked perfectly al dente, and the rich flavors of the ragu and texture of the duck crackling pieces on top were fantastic. Just note that the portion is large, and two people could easily share one serving of this rich risotto. There's a nice wine selection, with offerings from New Zealand and Italy.

The squid ink dish was a bit too salty for me but oddly my husband who usually likes less salt than me thought it was fine. Get the carpaccio!!",

        "text":"1\/1\/2018, my fiance and I arrived at Christchurch that day after a long drive from Picton. Not surprisingly many restaurants were closed for the holiday so we were searching for places on Yelp and calling the ones that seemed appealing. Luckily for us, Francesca's was open. We came here for a relatively early dinner and were able to get street parking. The restaurant itself is a quite larger open space, while I can't say it stood out appearance wise, it was definitely pleasant looking. We were seated almost immediately and considering that the rest of the city seemed to be abandoned, it was pretty lively in here. The menu has a decent amount of options, we usually order a bruscheta to start but didn't feel like it this time around so we just went with mains. I ordered the Pasta Norma (tomato, chili, capers, goats cheese, pecorino with casareccia pasta) while he went with the House made potato gnocchi (braised Wakanui beef cheeks, gremolata, pecorino). I enjoyed my dish a lot, it was fresh and flavorful. For a place of this size the service can often be compromised as waiters tend to forget about some tables, this wasn't the case here. Our time at this restaurant was short but definitely enjoyable.",

The house pinot grigio is very crisp and bright. The zucchini bruschetta was bland I think it needed salt And acid maybe. Not enough goat cheese either but the pear gorgonzola salad was terrific! Fresh and flavorful. My porcini prosecco risotto was rich but not overpowering. Decadent almost. I could have eaten more it was so good. Generous amount of mushrooms And cheese. Very nice dish. Would love to have it again. Well balanced. I could go on and on. The service was good and friendly. Prices were on par with everywhere else I've been in new zealand.

We saw the chef tossing the dough fresh before putting it into the pizza oven! This pizza came with pork sausage, tomato, roasted onion, ricotta, rocket and mozzarella. So... if you like cheesy sausage pizza, it's the one you want. We also ordered the lamb ragu paparadelle.

It ranks up as one of my top brunch spots in Christchurch and one not to be missed by locals and visitors alike. There will absolutely be a wait if you don't have a booking (and maybe even so if you do have a booking and tables haven't turned over, the space is small and the wait is worth it). If you try to walk in (as we did) the staff will usher you to a waiting room in the store next door and ask for your drink order. Having the coffee while we waited helped wake us up and keep us cheery. About 30 minutes later we were seated at a small wooden table with a chair on one side and wooden bench seat on the other. My husband ordered the Ham Hock Waffles and I ordered the Avocado Smash (not listed on their online menu). The Ham Hock Waffle was a large waffle smothered in ham hock bits and a tomato relish salad complete with melted cheese covering the waffle, chunks of soft cheese, tomatoes, rocket and sprouts. The presentation is fabulous, but the flavor is even better. The Avocado Smash was simply a piece of multi-grain toast simply smothered in smashed avacado and topped with a poached egg, served with polenta fries and chopped cherry tomatoes on the side. Holy Yum. I didn't even want to share with hubby, but since he let me try the waffle, I had to return the favor. VERY reluctantly. We also split a cinnamon bun, which disappeared from our plates before I could snap a photo. It was warm, gooey and fantastic. Overall, effective table turnover, presentation, wait time and taste all exceeded my expectations. You MUST try this brunch spot out!",

I would have preferred if the buns were toasted, and felt it was a little pricey - but the flavors and quality of ingredients lead me to believe that these guys know what they are doing - and are either on their way to greatness or are applying it to the other dishes. Next time, I would go for the salmon soup which they also recommended. Their only major fault was giving me a giant espresso when I ordered a flat white.

The pieces 'seemed' large... but I think the batter bulked them up... - Batter on fish: the batter was all bubbly and thick... sooo thick... it soaked up so much oil that it it fell apart. On some parts of the fish, the batter was raw... - Chips: chips were overcooked but thick cut, so they weren't terribly dry... but were very discoloured because they were overcooked. - Battered sausage: Horrible... this huge sausage with thick batter... the sausage was the size of a large Bratwurst. - Battered meat pattie: Gross.... I don't even know what this was... it was like 10% mince meat with 70% sausage meat with the leftover of flour paste... This wasn't pleasant at all... Unfortunately, we threw 70% of this out because it was almost inedible. Price was okay at $33 in total, but no way at all was it quality for money.",

We went for the trust the chef option because, well that was the only option I could choose when booking which has a penalty of $50 if you don't turn up. This have the place an air of exclusivity but it annoyed me. Not a good start but hey. We also noticed people were ordering what they liked, so not sure if there was a limit on order your own or not. Anyway, ordered some wine by the glass from a snotty waiter. A young guy who clearly needs to eat some humble pie. The other waiter thankfully was the opposite and real nice. So the food was below par, the chicken we got was cooked well, moat and tasty. But the rest of the 5 courses other than the dessert were how can I say, like stuff they wanted to get rid of. I'm short, for what you pay and what you get, which includes the service, the food, the experience, it's not worth the money. It's overpriced and there is much better offerings out there for less money and with more welcoming service.",

At that time, there was also no space in the lounge, so they directed us to the building lobby to sit down and offered us some water. During this time, I wish they would have given us a drink menu or something because it felt a little strange to just wait outside in this random lobby (also, another party was given a drink menu). Then, when we entered the restaurant, we were directed to these high barstools that overlook the kitchen area. It took until we started awkwardly draping our coats on the barstools for them to offer to take our coats (we also witnessed the hostess take the coats for others before us, so I'm not sure why it was so awkward for us). We did the 'Trust the chef\" option. The food was good, but not amazing. Some of the dishes were on the saltier side, and I couldn't finish the main entree, and they don't allow take away of any leftovers. The wine pairing was tasty and definitely showcased some great NZ wines! In the end, it was cool to watch the kitchen, but for the pricepoint, I was expecting a little better service.",

I've been to \"starred\" restaurants around the world, and live in LA (which has the most exciting restaurant scene in the world right now) and I feel Inati ranks right up there as a place of note. The duck trumpets (mini ice cream cones with duck mousse) , boeuf-nuts (donut holes with perfect beef) were excellent, but the charred broccoli was just spectacular.

        "text":"My wife and I enjoyed a wonderful dinner at Inati a few weeks ago. We had 7pm reservations and were promptly seated at the kitchen bar with a view of all the delicious dishes being prepared. The restaurant features a sharable menu in which you can either order dishes separately or you can \"Trust Us\". We had to go with the \"Trust Us\" menu, which featured six different dishes. We also added the wine pairing featuring local New Zealand wines that went perfectly with each dish. The first dish was the Tua Tua Clam Crudo, Cucumber & Gin. These tender and fresh clams were topped with citrusy crispy cucumbers. This was a light but flavorful dish and a nice way to start dinner. Next came my favorite dish of the night: Duck Trumpets & Blackberry Jam. Rich and creamy duck pate with a hint of sweet jam sat in a crispy waffle cone and was topped with crunchy nuts. This was an addictive balance of flavors and textures. I was on the verge of ordering another pair but the next dish distracted me: Charred Broccoli Root, Smoked Ricotta & Almonds. Inati turned the part of the broccoli that you threw away as a kid into something amazing! The broccoli stalk was super tender with a hint of smokiness and paired with creamy ricotta and crunchy almonds. Next was the Parsnip, Apple & Candied Walnut. I don't think I've ever had a parsnip before but I quickly became a fan! The vegetable was savory with a creamy topping (similar to mashed potatoes), sweet apples, and crisp walnuts. Aged Duck & Scratching was next. A crisp juicy lightly fatty skin surrounded mouthwatering, tender and lightly salty duck meat. An eggroll with even more tender duck meat added more deliciousness. Before our last dish (dessert), I wanted to order one more savory item that wasn't included in the \"Trust Us\" offering: Venison Bresaola, Seaweed & Pistachio. The venison was tender and gamey with a sweet jam and topped with powdered pistachios. Finally we had the Honey, Brown Butter & Sage for dessert. Airy and lightly sweet and salty custard was topped with creamy sweet sage ice cream and crunchy nuts. When in Christchurch, I highly recommend Inati for a nice date night.",

As a result we have had the good fortune to encounter many new and memorable foods, cooking techniques, and dining experiences. Inati was a one of our most recent gems. I have sent pictures and descriptions to friends & relatives stating that the evening we spent with Simon, Lisa and their staff was easily within one of the top 20 meals we've encountered in our 68 years. To describe the food would take many pages. I'll just say that everything is prepared by very highly skilled and motivated people who clearly love what they do. This alone is ample reason for all foodies to make this restaurant a priority. However, what really sets them apart is that the entire staff goes out of their way to make you feel that you are an important part of their evening and that they want you to feel as excited about what they are doing as they are. We are so glad that we get to return to Christchurch and re-visit Inati before we head back home from our vacation. The memories will stay with us for many years to come.",

I may as well get a membership to the gym, because I will be in the building, at Inati frequent enough to want to burn that guilt off at said gym. I could go to the gym, then go to Inati... Or just skip the gym all together. This place is incredible. World class fare, new style, eclectic takes on classic and modern cuisines. Butcher's \"scrapes\" honoring the whole beast. Using familiar, natural and curious (in a good way!) flavors, all rolled together and discovered in a single plate. With local organic ingredients. Small plates concept, with a couple larger plates available - I dined alone, so I opted to stick with the smaller plates (be warned larger plates. Your time will come to be inside me, too...) Tonight was my first time dining at Inati, and the food was very possibly the best I've had in all my years visiting Christchurch (about 9 years now). Possibly the best meal I've had in the whole of New Zealand. Service was professional, courteous and friendly (albeit the server was a little slow - Which is fine, as I recognized that there seemed to only be 2 front of the house staff, working the room. Maybe three? There was a guy who greeted me, but I couldn't tell his actual position. Sommelier\/Host maybe?) But, I was fortunate enough to sit in front of whom I presume was the Chef - Who helped with front of the house duties for his single diner guest. 2 notes of disappointment that I experienced: The drink selections seemed somewhat limited with only beer and wine options. I personally prefer a small, limited cocktail program as an apertif. As well as coffee and\/or espresso with dessert - But the restaurant is small, so it's forgivable that they may not have the room for a bar\/hot drinks area. Or I just didn't notice them on the menu, which is entirely possible, too. Secondly, the Chef's Table\/Bar seats are too high for my stubby frame and I kind of struggled to get in and out. No suggestions, just an observation. It certainly won't deter me from dining at the same seat again. Just. Plain. Delicious.",

        "text":"A Regrettable Experience at McDonald's A visit to the McDonald's on Memorial Ave has left much to be desired. The moment I stepped inside, it was clear that the level of service wasn't up to standard. The first problem arose at the ordering counter, where it was like they didn't give a damn or cared to take care of customers. It seemed to be as if my being there was a nuisance for them. Although the service lacked oomph, I pushed ahead with my order because I hoped that there'd be a surprise waiting for me on the platter. Unfortunately, this was not to be. The company's character would be the inedible food. The fries were lukewarm and soggywhich certainly was a far cry from the hot, crisp standard I've come to expect of other golden arches. The burger was no better, smashed together and rather lifeless. Another problem plaguing this McDonald's was cleanliness. Tables were abandoned to patrons past, covered with crumbs and spills. The overall hygiene of the dining area was suspect, and I have my doubts about how clean the kitchen or food preparation areas were. Also, the restroom was hardly attractive. It was dirty, there were bad odors and visible dirt; it needed immediate attention. Those conditions are something a fast-food restaurant, never mind one as big and globalized as McDonald's ought to be able to prevent. Finally, my visit to this McDonald's was one I would regret. Service overall was indifferent; food quality poor and cleanliness ignored. I hope that the management takes steps to resolve these problems and help restore McDonald's reputation, which it has been building over decades. And right now, I cannot pinpoint this particular location and tell others to try it if they want a positive experience with fast food. - Josh Nuzak",

Only had tacos, chimichangas, ceviche, and quesadilla on the menu. The tacos were good & the Margarita was fair but the chimichangas couldn't be eaten because they were so salty.

But everything else was closed on New Year's and we ended up here - a real blessing in disguise. We ordered a steak taco, a fish taco, and guac to start. All were great.

Good but not exceptional. - Fried chicken: 5 stars. Crispy and flavorful. With 2 different but equally delicious creamy dipping sauces. - Pork cheek barbacoa soft taco: 5 stars. Flavorful and the pork goes so well with the pineapple elements in this taco! - Pipian chicken soft taco: 4 stars. Solid. Nice crunch from the sunflower seeds. One downside: the first night we came was a Monday around 8:15pm. While waiting to be seated, we were turned away and told that they were closing early because it wasn't busy enough. What?!

We put our name down for a table for 2 (1 hour wait) and headed to the bar area for drinks and snacks. Reservations are only accepted for groups 6 or more, so be prepared to wait for dinner reservations. In the bar area, the whole menu is provided for the bar area though only snacks and tacos are available for purchase. Upon seeing that, we canceled our table, ate tacos and salsa and had a caraf of margs. The guac and salsa was solid, but our chips were stale. :-\/ Their tacos however, are DELICIOUS! Small portion size but healthy and filling. Definitely reminds me of Southern California's take on Mexican. Order the lamb if it's on special and don't miss out on the chicken! The prices are also extremely affordable which is great. My gripe with the menu is that it is extremely limited. Where are the enchilladas? One third of the page is food, one third advertising and one third drinks. I'd like to see more dinner options available. The staff still seems a little overwhelmed (give the people some credit, it's brand new!) but our drink order was forgotten as they have a confusing system of who handles the drink orders. Keeping drink orders to the respective seating area (bar v dining area) will stop that in the future. Also, to pay our tab we had to go to two different people (the front of the house and then back to the bar to get our card). There are still some inefficiencies to work out here. I'm confident they will be soon fixed. I will say though that the staff is eager to please and will do whatever it takes to make sure you leave happy. And we did! Definitely take some time to check this spot out and bring back the CBD!",

When we mentioned it to the waiter, he smelled the carafe and told us it indeed contained tequila. We complained again when the bill came. The manager came to talk with us, asking us if we knew how to make a margarita, telling us that Mexico's margaritas are designed to not have a tequila taste and questioning our experience of what a good margarita tastes like. After I asked him if he was making us wrong he backed off and took the cost of the margaritas off the bill. The manager would have been ahead had he just asked us what we needed to make us happy - eliminating the difference between the virgin and non-virgin option would have done it...but his arguing with us has just made us more unhappy. We've been to Mexico in Wellington and Christchurch. The food is creative and tasty and we particularly appreciate their attention to providing gluten free options but we'll never order margaritas here. Their original margarita (ordered in Wellington) wasn't very good and this rosewater variation in Christchurch wasn't good either. Based on two tries we conclude Mexico doesn't \"get\" margaritas.",

This place gets ROWDY, particularly before a big event, so don't plan to come here on some intimate date.

I've gone to it several times at this point because the hospitality is so excellent and the food is incredible. The owner is very passionate about their food, and it's obvious that he's in the business because he loves bringing joy into people's lives by providing a wonderful dining experience. He's happy to tell you about the food you're eating, such as how he would normally be eaten, or on what occasions, or how it differs from similar Indian dishes. For me that is a very wonderful addition to the meal, but if you are just looking for a place to consume your requisite nutrients and get on with your day then you should consider saving this restaurant for an occasion when you can give the experience the attention it deserves. Every time I have gone I have gotten one of the specials, which have variable names like \"Chicken Special No.2,\" but they have consistently been the most delightful meals--ones that are not only tasty, but also complicated enough that you're glad you're not trying to make your own version in your own kitchen. The one I had on my previous visit was the best chicken dish which I have had in years. I highly recommend this place.",

The food took a long time to come - they kept saying it was cooked fresh but having to wait over 40 minutes for some simple starters isn't great. Most restaurants I go to cook their food fresh and it doesn't take that long. The quality of the food was also pretty poor - the fish cake starter was dry and lacked flavor, and my daughter had the chicken and rice which looked very unappetizing, tasted pretty mediocre, and was only lukewarm. When we complained about the long wait for the food the owner was rude and aggressive - both to us, and the the woman who was serving us -- he tried to blame her for the delay for some of our items by saying that she should have told us they were unavailable (even though they clearly were available because he delivered them to us five minutes later??!???). They have some work to do to improve the quality of their food and their service if they want to tempt me back. I would not recommend them and I would not eat here again. Very poor. I am sure the owner will respond and claim that we were unreasonable - ordinarily I would say go along and see for yourself, but I wouldn't wish this experience on anyone. The food is not worth it and the service sucks!!",

Normally, this place hovers around a 3.5 to 4-star level: decent enough to keep you from cooking, reliable enough to order again. But tonight, their food and service took a nosedive. I was served what I can only assume was fried rice left to cook while the chef took a nap or wandered off for a bathroom break. Charred, bitter, and completely inedible. One dish out of a four-dish order, sure - but the rest of the family ate while mine sat on the bench like a warning from the culinary gods. I called, thinking a refund for the burnt mess would be reasonable. Apparently not. Maybe they like their rice blackened to oblivion, but I prefer mine edible. We used to order every week.

We both chose the fried chicken burger. It came with fries. Sounds simple and boring, but no, it was amazing. The burger was not, I believe, a single piece of chicken breast. It seemed to be various nice pieces of well trimmed chicken that had been, with the help of cheese, formed into a patty and then breaded and fried. It was topped with thinly sliced pickled onions, like the pink ones you get in Mexico, mild dill pickle and thinly sliced red chilies. It was not super spicy hot, but perfectly spiced up the sandwich. Wonderful! The fries were simply amazing. Thick cut and freshly prepared, they were served with a bowl of large grain sea salt on the side along with a small container of ketchup. I'm not sure what had been added to the ketchup, but it had a very unique and very tasty combination that complimented the fries as well. The burgers were NZ $22 each (US 15) and worth every penny. We had an amazing New Zealand Riesling from Pegasus Bay winery near Christchurch. It's famous winery & top rated Riesling. So depending on what you want for a beverage will determine your bill, but for us, this place was great value for money and a very memorable tasty lunch",

Other than some novelty shirts and sausage, they only sell one thing: lamb shoulder with scalloped potatoes and you can buy bread baguettes. The sales guy was great, even showed us the plate of food so we could understand sizing, and recommended bread for soaking up the juice. The lamb is so tender, almost like a pot roast, with a lovely, crispy exterior. The potatoes are not as cheesy as scalloped potatoes I've had in the past, but they accompany the lamb very well. Definitely get the bread...because soaking up the juice is the best part!

I have not found a place in the world that cooks 'em up better than Pedro's in Christchurch. If you mistook this place for a place that screws around, then you would be mistooken. They most certainly do not. Pedro knows what the people want, and what they want is a big ol' lamb shoulder + potatoes, bathed in the juices, paired with either a top quality brew from an establishment like 8 Wired, Epic, Renaissance, Tuatara, or Liberty, or a top quality pinot noir from Central Otago. That is it. You do not need anything else on the menu, or in life. (Maybe tacos occasionally, and a good episode of \"Game of Thrones\") If you're by yourself like me, aimlessly roaming around New Zealand as Bob Dylan would say \"Like a Rolling Stone\" (in my case I like to picture myself as Mick Jagger), and you go here, be hungry. Very hungry. There's one meal you can get here. It's enormous, and it's $40. Want something else? Something smaller? On a diet? Vegan? If so, the only thing to do is GTFO and STFU. The guy there pegged me as a morbidly obese McDonald's-gruffling American even though I'm only a slightly overweight taco-gruffling American, and he said I could probably finish it all. Dude thinks we're all Joey Chestnut. I'm not, so it lasted two meals. May last more than two for you if you're not American and\/or not fat. In short, this place is the most legit lamb joint in Kiwiland. For the upcoming elections for the king of the \"Game of Thrones\" House Lambister, I have three words for you: VOTE FOR PEDRO!",

It's lamb, out of a food truck, with sketchy ever-changing hours, no seating, and they run out of food some days if you leave it til too late, but they do their roast lamb right. We got a lamb shoulder for $35, which fed two girls (*ahem* ladies) for two meals - so I think a family of four could turn this into one tasty, complete meal. The lamb came with potatoes, also done right, in a large takeout aluminum container. Definitely delicious, and definitely worth a try. I thought it was expensive at first until I realized how much food we got. Dinner for four for $35 in NZ? That's practically unheard of!",

They also sell some pork products imported from various parts of Europe, but that's definitely not the emphasis. The first night we tried coming here we found that the lamb was already sold out- the owner kindly told us that it'd behoove us to call in an order for the next day (which was the last day of our trip in NZ). We did so, and picked up a HUGE leg of lamb and a large tray of potatoes for ~$50 NZD. The leg was more than enough to feed my parents, my wife, and me. Flavor wise, the lamb was done very well- it was simply roast lamb done right. There was a crisp but not charred\/burnt surface, with a pool of natural juices enhancing the flavor of each bite of meat we dipped into it. We ate our meal off of a picnic bench in front of a bunch of kids playing tennis before returning our rental car to the airport. Nothing elegant about it- and I woudn't've had it any other way. This place is a winner folks.",

Food was very tasty with authentic flavors, but can be adjusted for Western palates (primarily by dialing down the heat). If you have spicy food lovers, be sure to ask for the chilies on the side...they pack a lot of heat! We enjoyed the Le Pet Thoke salad, Seit Da Kin (lamb skewers) and Jetda Ono Hin curry. Everything was delicious and goes well with their selection of beers. Only thing that I would change is perhaps having a little more tea leaves in the Le Pet Thoke.

        "text":"Burmese food in Christchurch? We were intrigued so we decided to check out Rangoon Ruby for our first dinner in town. It's merged with The Bodhi Tree so don't confuse the two; it's now under one roof. Mama Hooch is located right next door to them. We dropped in for an early Monday dinner (around 5:45pm). The inside is gorgeous with two floors and a very clean, modern look. Interesting that most of the clientele was Caucasian. The menu is short and sweet; nibbly bits, soups, vegetable\/salad, meat, seafood and desserts. The drink menu is standard but at least the bottles are reasonable. - Lepet thoke ($14.50 NZD) - tea leaf salad is a Burmese speciality. Pickled tea leaves mixed with lentils, nuts, sesame seeds and chili. Barely any heat nor much tea leaf flavour but still a tasty dish. Also, way too pricey for such a small appetizer. - 2x steamed rice ($3.00 NZD\/person) - we weren't sure but turns out you can get free refills on rice. Sweet because it's steep enough for plain white rice. - Nga kin ($17.50 NZD) - a boneless fillet of fresh fish (grouper) baked in the oven. When this dish got dropped off, we did a double take. Smallest piece of fish I've seen on a plate. Fish was nicely cooked but plain. Luckily, the side sauce was BOMB; could have drank that on its own. It was sweet, spicy and tangy (a mix of soy sauce, fish sauce, vinegar, cilantro, chives and hot pepper). - Seit da nut ($16.50 NZD) - lamb curry cooked with lemongrass, ginger and curry leaves. You get three pieces; again, small portion but the lamb was tender and delicious. Wish that you'd get some vegetables with this dish. Good flavours but know coming in that portions are small. 3.5 stars.",

The serving was plenty for two people and it comes with some salad greens despite not being listed in the menu. A table beside us ordered fish and chips and that also came with some salad greens.

We all went for the surprise 5 course menu which was great. Everything was very fresh (especially scallops and gropher fish), and tasty. The better French food I have ever tried, that's for sure. The dessert was the star, poached pear, blue cheese ice cream and red wine reduction. Amazing!!!!!! Not too sweet, and just a little pungent from the cheesy ice cream. My one frustration was that our wine was constantly filled up, and we felt compelled to drink more than we usually would. I ended up with 6 drinks poured - I would usually only have 3 so felt unwell after - but didn't want to waste good French wine. Please ask your customers before refilling. Other than that, it was a great experience.",

In all fairness though, that may just be my own poor sense of direction. Park in the hotel right next door. This is a very elegant restaurant with a classic and restrained decor. Tables are beautifully laid out with white tablecloths and the chairs are comfortable but of a solid quality (my favourite type). We went on a random wednesday night so it was fairly quiet. Service was excellent - a french waiter which certainly adds to the ambience! As for food, I was a little disappointed. Maybe my expectations were to high. I ordered the escargot (entree) and the cassoulet (main). Both were good but didn't wow me. The duck in the cassoulet was actually a little dry. My friend picked much better than me and next time I would probably order what she had. She had the foie gras for entree and the steak for main and both were absolutely excellent. Perfectly cooked, lovely well balanced flavours. Dessert was delicious, I can never go past a perfectly cooked chocolate fondant. Good wine menu, and served in nice big glasses which I like. Next time I would probably choose the surprise menu, the only reason I didn't this time is that I had a major craving for some cassoulet and some escargot and didn't want to take the risk that they might not be included! Price wise this is at the top end of the scale for Christchurch but food and ambience are of a high quality. That said $90 each for a three course meal and a glass of wine is not unreasonable. Bottom line: great for a fancy date night, or just randomly treating yourself (like we chose to do!)",

We established that we had a reservation and were then directed to a table. There next to ours was another empty 2 seater table with a view out the window so we decided to move to that. Another member of staff came over and she proceeded to snap at us to move back to our original table. We decided to leave before ordering anything. I have never been treated this rudely by staff.

This was what we ordered: Kikorangi Blue Cheese Plate Salmon Ceviche Braised Lamb Pappardelle Tropical Coconut Freeze All the dishes lack in flavor, especially the Pappardelle. Watered down sauce, with no flavors, and the pasta was not good. The lamb was so tough and it shouldn't be because it was braised. As for the ceviche, they give you a lot but its does not look like the normal ceviche you would get anywhere else, just gross. We did like the Tropical Coconut Freeze.

Its just angel cake splash with some fresh berries (which we appreciated and lots of whipped cream and sauce) Angel cake was decent . 6\/10 Poached Pear and Ginger Pudding - it was also good but nothing wowing! 7.5\/10 Well this also depends on what you like but seems like the locals here usually go for the cheesecake and chocolate cakes.

        "text":"This is absolutely one of my favorite restaurants in Christchurch. It is the perfect spot for all occasions: anniversary, Sunday brunch, casual afternoon catch-up with a friend, drinks and especially dessert! The second story seems to attract a little bit of a nicer-dressed crowd while the lower level seems to be for those who just rolled out of bed or came from a workout. I wouldn't come here in anything less than a nice pair of jeans, at least. Strawberry Fare prides itself on serving local, fresh and organic food whenever possible, so you won't find fresher food anywhere else. For breakfast I have tried the french toast (which I think is their best breakfast item), the BET (which just seemed plain, though the flavors are nice), the blueberry pancakes which are delicious and looks like the batter is poured over a scoop of large blueberries on the skillet. The Corn and Capsicum Fritters and Salmon Deluxe were huge favorites with my friends. For lunch I enjoyed the bruschetta and the summer chicken salad. The bruschetta is fresh and the summer salad is refreshing but also has large pieces of asparagus. For dessert I absolutely recommend the Sunken Chocolate Cake. It is gluten free and vegan, but you would never know. It is also beautifully decorated with thin, frozen honey drizzle. The little girls I was with devoured their ice cream sundaes (but who doesn't love ice cream?) The cool thing about Strawberry Fare though is their baking school! You can take classes at the restaurant to learn to bake (almost) as good as their chefs. This is definietly an experience everyone must do! If you haven't been to Strawberry Fare, put it next on your list - you'll be glad you did!",

Good marketing, but it would be better yet if the desserts were actually better for the price charged. Citrus Dreamy Cheesecake is closer to one of those gelatin cheesecakes that doesn't have much taste, The Chocolate Drench cake is really a mud cake - wish it had been advertised as such. If you want a dense slab of chocolate, that's the one for you. I was hoping for a nice piece of actual cake.",

I came specifically to this restaurant wanting some oysters; if they had told me from the beginning that they were sold out, I could have chosen another place. The waiter called the manager, who insisted that she had informed me (but she really hadn't; the only thing she said to me was, \"We didn't have many servers today, so the water was a little late, please forgive us\").

I am still waiting for my refund nearly 2 weeks later which is disappointing. Happy to change this review if I receive my refund. EDIT: Shortly after posting this review I finally received my refund.

If you're with a group, there's a great private dining area off the side - so quiet, you'd think you're at home. The menu is great, and as the name suggests, there are a large number of stone plate dishes that come out sizzling hot! One of our favourites is the sharing platter. Great value for 2 people, and less than two mains. We struggle to eat it all. Pretty much an entree, main and dessert all on one board! They have regular specials on different nights.

The location is only a few blocks away from the touristy hustle and bustle, and really close to the local street tram stop, so it was very convenient.",

Menu has many options and they were serving brunch until 3 PM on Sunday. I opted for sharing the corn and and crab soup with my aunt, and having the grilled cauliflower with halpumi, couscous and arugula salad. I was very impressed by the number of vegetarian options at this Gastro pub like spot. Most of the patrons were seated near the door or outside. Many were enjoying beers and snacks that afternoon. I was also super happy that the food was not overly salted. In fact I could've used a little bit more but was glad for them to err on the side of less. Service was friendly and helpful; the only drawback was that I asked for my bill three times before it came.",

I tried 2 other's that friend's ordered which were equally delicious, unique and healthy. The place is decorated and designed with opulence - a gallery in itself.

The research and time spent in getting each dish just right goes on behind the scenes and certainly shows in their presentation. Coming here is like entering a wonderful world of sheer bliss. Run by the Sri Chinmoy meditation centre, this restaurant certainly deserves high class credit for all their work they have put into their beautiful building, the small shops hiding away that bring dazzle and fun to the whole experience.

To me shrimp paste is not vegetarian, so curry was not an option for us. So we ordered pad thai instead, along with pad puk, a vegetable stir fry in vegan sauce. Instead of a side of rice, I ordered roti for the stir fry, but the roti was way too oily; after the first bite I couldn't have any more of it. The pad thai was good, and the stir fry was good as well. Too bad they didn't have any soups or curries that could be made vegan, since that's what we were craving in the first place. The place is quite cozy with small tables for two, and service was good.",

My companion and I ordered a lunch menu curry each (mine costing $15), additional options being red meats, chicken, or vegetables, we asked if we could substitute prawns instead. They did provide our seafood alternative, however did not mention any additional fees. I ordered a Panang Curry, it was quite rich but still tasty and satisfying. The prawns however hadn't been correctly prepared, some still with scales. I ordered a beverage with my meal which was listed at $8. When I paid, I requested a receipt. I was charged an additional $2 for my curry, and was charged $9 for my drink. I couldn't help but mention the extra charge for my curry, as the person who served me did not care to bring it up when I ordered. I was refunded the additional fee, and refunded the extra paid for the beverage. Overall, the food was good enough, and the service had issues but managed to make up for them.",

The waitress was unapproachable & had a bit of a attitude (worst thing is I am sure she was the duty manager). My friend asked what was gluten-free as she can get severely sick from ingesting gluten- this comment was not well received & she was told to read the menu. The menu did not say whether the fish was dredged in flour! The potato skins promised truffle but sadly there was none. The main meals were good. The dessert was very lack lustre. The PBJ was average- only redeeming part was the raspberry sorbet. My friend got the ice-cream sandwich which was inedible. You needed a pick-axe to even attempt it. The part we could try was the ice-cream but only a small bit we managed to chip off. It was icy!! What was the chef thinking even plating this up! The sponge was rock solid. My friend paid for it & all the chef said that if we'd said something about it, they could've fixed it. We did but the waitress didn't care. And let's be real- there was no saving that dessert. So if you want an below average meal with terrible service and pay plenty of $$$ for the experience, please be Town Tonic's next guest. All I can say is diner beware!!",

I was a little nervous, but we chose to stay and were seated at a tall top table by the window. I suppose the crew that visited Town Tonic into the wee hours of the morning were still sleeping off their hangovers. Our waiter was a little quirky, but friendly and efficient. We ordered an americano and a trim flat white. They both arrived quickly. The menu is very concise which makes choosing your entree easy. There are your breakfast classics: muesli or french toast, but the rest of the menu features eclectic specialty items that are impeccably prepared: Mexican Salad, Duck Liver, French Sardines, vegetarian options or the Gourmet Croque Madame. The croque madame was served on thick slices of bread with prosciutto \"really good cheese\" (their words, not mine), mustard all drowned in truffle oil with a fried egg on top. If you're not a true fan of truffle oil, this sandwhich will be a bit overwhelming by the second half, but the first half will be amazing. I ate every bite. The large hot breakfast looked like something straight from a mexican restaurant: Mushrooms, potatoes with jalape\u00f1os, tomatoes, a fried egg. My husband licked the plate clean and said this is one of his all time favorite meals in Christchurch (he didn't even save me a bite). We were very pleased with our breakfast option and recommend this joint to anyone in the area to check out for breakfast, lunch, dinner or drinks!",

How pretty! I told the waitress to \"bring me something sweet and white,\" for a wine, and that she did. There are two sizes of wine offered (see lines on your glass), and I chose the smaller one. I was brought riesling (see photo), which was light, sweet, and had a clean finish. It was just what I wanted! I give 3 stars because of the spaghetti carbonara. It was quite oily, and the balance of pasta vs the mushrooms and bacon was not correct. My bowl was still 1\/3 full of the other stuff even though I'd finished the pasta. Furthermore, the top layer of parmesan melted and hardened, to the point of being inedible. If you're Italian, you may want to ask for no cheese on top since this isn't done in Italy (at least where I was in Rome, Florence, etc). I also ordered the side of salad greens. I wasn't told it came with dressing or what kind (normally don't eat dressing), so I was surprised to see a brown gravy-like substance on top. It turned out to be a balsamic vinegar based dressing, but be sure to specify if you're particular about dressing. I wouldn't mind coming here again but also wouldn't mind skipping this place next time. My whole meal cost $42, including the wine. On to the next!",

Trust me we have eaten at quite a few places since we have been traveling. We ate outside and the manager couldn't get the heater to work so no heat. The Long Island Ice Tea didn't do the trick either!! I mean so people get heated up when drinking. It didn't happen for me at all. We were served our food and the waitstaff person did not even check on us. We had to chase her down for our dinner tab. My husband had the spaghetti and I had the ribs.",

We went during peak dinner hours on a Tuesday, so street parking was a bit tight and we ended up having to park down a side street and walk a bit, but not too much of a problem. We didn't have a reservation so we were seated at a counter and then later moved to a table. The highlight was definitely the tiramisu --delicious and served with a little scoop of gelato as well. The penne carbonara was also cooked well and tasty. The cannelloni was decent but really packed with spinach --could've used a bit more of the cheese mixed in to balance out the flavor. The burrata appetizer was not my favorite as the inside of the cheese was not very soft and runny. The service was decent throughout and the prices were about what I would expect for the area.",

In the summer months they have \"dining al Fresco\" in their back courtyard. Though it is tucked under umbrellas and right along a little creek, it is patio seating in a parking lot by dumpsters. Not totally my thing. However, the rest of the restaurant has plenty of seating for groups or intimate date settings as well as casual tables up front. The pizza is FANTASTIC. The Cantadina, Margherita, Pollo Pesto and Quattro Formaggi are among my favorites. Di Carne and Umbria are my partner's. He prefers bold flavors like black olives and meat while I am after the cheese and basil. My dad has ordered the traditional spaghetti (bolognese) and our whole family had to dig in and eat some of it. The Della Casa salad is a great salad to split to add some more greens to the meal. The waiters will gladly help you pair a great wine with your meal if you ask. The service is efficient as they need to keep the tables turning over and if you call for takeaway, as I do frequently, the order will be ready in 20 minutes. Though the price is a bit steep for a pizza, you have to remember that you're paying for the best (and the cost of overhead in Merivale). This is a great date night spot or a great place to order takeaway for your family on a weekday night. The food is quality every single time and made with love, the true Italian way.",

There's a good amount of paid street parking right in front of the restaurant, and there is also outdoor seating for anyone who wants fresh air or has a dog in tow. The breakfast is pretty hearty. I had the 2 eggs with toast. I asked for the eggs over medium; however, they came out over easy. I figured it was just lost in translation. Overall, the eggs were a little too underdone for me, but the toast was very good. I also had the mango\/coconut smoothie which was very coconut forward, which I enjoyed. It looked like a lot of the other patrons were enjoying their berry smoothies! My husband had the breakfast burrito which pretty much had to be eaten as a open-faced burrito since there was so much filling! I loved that it came with a good amount of avocado as well. His long black coffee was more bitter than the other ones we had tried in other parts of New Zealand, but it was still pretty good. Bonus - water station where you serve yourself.

Seriously, that was the best pizza I have had in Christchurch! It even tastes great as leftovers. We also tried the jalapeno bites which was basically a fried ball filled with a chipotle mayo\/jalapeno mix.

        "text":"Never thought I would find so much foreign food in New Zealand. I don't really know what I was expecting. I guess I assumed it would be burgers, fish and chips, seafood and lamb. With the occasional Chinese restaurant sprinkled in. Because they're in every country. But Thai? From New Zealand? And pretty much the entire crew are Kiwis?? No fruit isn't running this restaurant that's what they call themselves here. This place though.. It was good. Really good! The inside has an upscale look but you don't need to dress classy to eat here. They don't overdo the fact that they are an Asian restaurant. You know how some places can be.. Oooh let's put a tiger in that corner, and oh a Buddha in that corner, maybe a temple print wallpaper.. No no. This place keeps it simple. Staff was great. They don't work for tips in New Zealand but still cared about me just as much. Let's talk food!! The menu runs deep. Like 50 numbers deep. We ordered 3 items. 38-Black Pepper Stir Fry, 20-Pad Thai, 12-Tom Kar which is a soup. Everything had such great flavor. Lots of meat in our dishes to. 3 items and it was plenty for 3 of us. And they make sure to label the menu to let you know what is spicy, and extra spicy. So no surprises here! Oh they also have a small section for Vietnamese food. Shutout to my Viet friends. But.. We didn't order any of that. 5 stars for great food and service!",

We got the fresh spring rolls (reasonably good; like a salad in a spring roll wrap), the green curry with tofu (excellent), and the spicy noodles with tofu (also delicious). Lunch prices were very reasonable. So glad we stopped here!",

They forgot our pork balls, then we reminded them, they brought them out but still it wasn't great... they were very plain balls with a sweet pineapple sauce... The pepper beef was nice but I would've enjoyed it more if it had more pepper. Overall though, this place is nice. Service is great - they check how the meal is going etc and cater to ANY allergies. Go there - you won't regret it.",
